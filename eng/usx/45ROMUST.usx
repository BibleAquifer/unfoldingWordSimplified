<chapter number="1" style="c" sid="ROM 1"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 1:1"/>{I,} Paul, {am writing this letter}. I serve the Messiah Jesus. He called me to represent him and specially chose me to proclaim God’s good news.<verse eid="ROM 1:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 1:2"/>God previously promised this good news by means of his spokesmen who prophesied about it {and wrote it down} in the sacred writings.<verse eid="ROM 1:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 1:3"/>{This good news is} about God’s Son. He was born a natural descendant of David.<verse eid="ROM 1:3"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 1:4"/>In accordance with the Holy Spirit, God powerfully demonstrated that Jesus is his Son by causing him to live again after he had died. {God’s Son is} Jesus the Messiah, {who is} our Lord.<verse eid="ROM 1:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 1:5"/>Jesus favored us who represent him and authorized us to represent him on his behalf in order that all the nations would obey {God} by trusting {in Jesus the Messiah}.<verse eid="ROM 1:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 1:6"/>Jesus the Messiah has also called you who are {living} among the nations.<verse eid="ROM 1:6"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 1:7"/>{I am writing this letter} to all of you {believers} who dwell in the city of Rome. God loves you and has called you to be people who belong to him. {May} God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Messiah {continue to} be kind to you and make you peaceful.<verse eid="ROM 1:7"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 1:8"/>Now, {the} first {thing I want to tell you, is that} I am constantly thanking my God through Jesus the Messiah for all of you {believers in the Messiah}. {I thank him} because {people} throughout the known world are proclaiming how you trust {in Jesus}.<verse eid="ROM 1:8"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 1:9"/>{I can say this truthfully} because God testifies for me that I frequently pray for you. I serve him devotedly by proclaiming the good news about his Son{, Jesus}.<verse eid="ROM 1:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 1:10"/>{When} I pray, I very often request that I might finally succeed in coming to {visit} you because God wants {me to}.<verse eid="ROM 1:10"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 1:11"/>{I pray for this} because I deeply desire to see you {in person} in order to share some kind of gracious gift with you from the Holy Spirit in order to help you become spiritually stronger.<verse eid="ROM 1:11"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 1:12"/>In other words, {I want to share some gracious gift with you} in order that we may mutually encourage one other. Both you and I can help each other by sharing how we mutually trust in God.<verse eid="ROM 1:12"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 1:13"/>My fellow believers, I certainly want you to know that I planned to visit you many times. But {God} has prevented me from visiting you until the present time. {I planned to visit you} in order to lead some people to believe in Christ among you as well, just like {how I have} also {done so} among the other nations.<verse eid="ROM 1:13"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 1:14"/>I am obligated {to proclaim the good news} to all non-Jewish people, whether or not they are {culturally} Greek and whether or not they are educated.<verse eid="ROM 1:14"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 1:15"/>So then, if it were my choice, I would gladly proclaim the good news to you who dwell in Rome.<verse eid="ROM 1:15"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 1:16"/>{I would gladly do this} because I am deeply honored to proclaim the good news because it is the powerful way that God uses to save anyone who believes {it}. {This is true for} both the Jews {who} first {heard the good news} and then everyone else.<verse eid="ROM 1:16"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 1:17"/>{This is true} because whenever {people proclaim} the good news, they reveal how God makes people righteous, which is entirely through trusting {in the Messiah}. This is what {the prophet Habakkuk meant when} he wrote {in the Scriptures}, “But the person whom God makes righteous will live forever by trusting {in God}.”<verse eid="ROM 1:17"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 1:18"/>{This is true} because from where God dwells he is revealing how he is furious toward {and will judge} every person who does ungodly and unrighteous things. These people suppress the things that God says are true by living in an unrighteous manner.<verse eid="ROM 1:18"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 1:19"/>{God will judge them} because what anyone can know about God is obvious to these people since God has made it obvious to them.<verse eid="ROM 1:19"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 1:20"/>{This is true} because people can clearly perceive those things about God that they cannot see {with their eyes}. {These things are} how powerful God is and the fact that he is God. {People could perceive these things} since the time God created the universe. The things that God has made have understood {these things}. For this reason, people cannot excuse themselves {from acknowledging that God exists}.<verse eid="ROM 1:20"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 1:21"/>{People cannot excuse themselves} because they do not honor him as God, even though they know that he exists. They also refuse to thank him. In contrast, they think about worthless things, and they are unable to understand spiritual things.<verse eid="ROM 1:21"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 1:22"/>{Although} they assert that they are wise, they are {actually} fools.<verse eid="ROM 1:22"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 1:23"/>They stop glorifying the God who is immortal, and instead they glorify idols that resemble mortal people, birds, four-legged animals, and animals that crawl {on the ground}.<verse eid="ROM 1:23"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 1:24"/>Consequently, God lets these people do the lustful things that they desire to do, so that they become {spiritually} impure and they disgrace their bodies with one another {by doing sexually immoral acts}.<verse eid="ROM 1:24"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 1:25"/>These people stop believing what is true about God and instead believe what is false {about idols}. They reverently worship things that God has created, instead of {worshiping} {the God} who created those things. {He is the one} whom people should bless forever! May it be so!<verse eid="ROM 1:25"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 1:26"/>Because {these people do that}, God lets them do the dishonorable things they strongly desire {to do}. For example, their women stop doing natural {sexual} acts {with men} and instead do unnatural {sexual} acts {with women}.<verse eid="ROM 1:26"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 1:27"/>Similarly, the men also stopped doing natural {sexual} acts with women {and} lusted intensely after other men. These men do shameless {sexual} acts with each other. They experience God penalizing them in their own bodies. {God must penalize them} because they pervert {God’s natural sexual acts}.<verse eid="ROM 1:27"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 1:28"/>As these people thought that acknowledging God was worthless, God let their minds become worthless. As a result, they do inappropriate things.<verse eid="ROM 1:28"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 1:29"/>{These people} are completely controlled by all kinds of unrighteous, wicked, covetous, and malicious {thoughts}. They are completely willing to be jealous, take another’s life, argue, deceive, and commit evil deeds {against others}. They reveal secrets {about others}.<verse eid="ROM 1:29"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v" sid="ROM 1:30"/>They speak badly of {other people}. They hate God. They act violently. They think too highly of themselves. They boast {about themselves}. They think of {new kinds of} evil things {to do}. They do not obey their parents.<verse eid="ROM 1:30"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v" sid="ROM 1:31"/>These people are {morally} foolish. They do not do what they promise to do. They do not care {about other people}. They do not show mercy {to others}.<verse eid="ROM 1:31"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="32" style="v" sid="ROM 1:32"/>These people fully understand that God has righteously declared that people who keep doing such {inappropriate} things deserve to die {spiritually}. {Nevertheless,} they not only keep on doing those {inappropriate} things, but they even happily approve of people who do such things!<verse eid="ROM 1:32"/></para>
<chapter eid="ROM 1"/>
<chapter number="2" style="c" sid="ROM 2"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 2:1"/>Consequently, any one of you who judges another person cannot excuse yourself {at all} {when God condemns you}. {This is} because you are actually condemning yourself when you judge someone else, since you who judge someone else do the exact same things {that they do}!<verse eid="ROM 2:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 2:2"/>Certainly, we acknowledge that God will correctly judge those people who continue doing such {inappropriate} things.<verse eid="ROM 2:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 2:3"/>You who judge the people who continue to do such {inappropriate} things while you do the exact same things yourself should certainly not think that you can escape when God judges you!<verse eid="ROM 2:3"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 2:4"/>You who despise {how} abundantly kind, tolerant, and patient God is must certainly know that God’s kind acts {are meant to} cause you to repent.<verse eid="ROM 2:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 2:5"/>Instead, because you are stubborn and refuse to repent, you are causing God to punish you even more severely. {This will happen} when God punishes {sinners} and reveals how justly he judges.<verse eid="ROM 2:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 2:6"/>God will {justly} reward or punish everyone for whatever they do.<verse eid="ROM 2:6"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 2:7"/>Living eternally {is how God repays} those people who keep striving for God to glorify, honor, and preserve them {forever}. {They do this} by persisting in doing what is good.<verse eid="ROM 2:7"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 2:8"/>By contrast, God will fiercely punish those people who refuse to do what he says is true and right because they are selfishly ambitious.<verse eid="ROM 2:8"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 2:9"/>{God will cause} every human being who does what is evil to become distressed and troubled. {This will happen} especially to the Jew {who does what is evil} and also to everyone else {who does so}.<verse eid="ROM 2:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 2:10"/>By contrast, God will glorify, honor, and reconcile every person who does what is good. {This will happen} especially to the Jew {who does what is good} and also to everyone else {who does so}.<verse eid="ROM 2:10"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 2:11"/>{These things are true} because God is impartial.<verse eid="ROM 2:11"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 2:12"/>{We know this about God,} because he will punish forever all people who sin without {knowing} the laws {that God gave the Jews} {even though} they do not know those laws. At the same time, God will judge according to his laws whoever sins while knowing those laws.<verse eid="ROM 2:12"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 2:13"/>{God will judge everyone who sins} because God does not make righteous those people who {only} hear his laws. Rather, God will make righteous those people who obey his laws.<verse eid="ROM 2:13"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 2:14"/>{God will judge everyone who sins} because whenever nations which do not know the laws {that God gave the Jews} naturally obey rules from those laws, {they prove that} they know laws within their minds even though they do not know God’s laws.<verse eid="ROM 2:14"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 2:15"/>{By naturally following some laws that God gave through Moses,} these people demonstrate that God has made each person aware of how to obey his laws. What they think shows that this is true, in that what each of them thinks will either accuse or even defend their actions.<verse eid="ROM 2:15"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 2:16"/>{This will happen} at the time when God {finally} judges the hidden thoughts that people think. {God’s} good news that I proclaim teaches that he will judge {mankind} through the Messiah Jesus.<verse eid="ROM 2:16"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 2:17"/>Now, {I am addressing} you who identify yourselves as Jews: You depend on the laws {God gave you} {to avoid God’s judgment}. You brag that you know God.<verse eid="ROM 2:17"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 2:18"/>You know what God wants. Also, since {some people} have taught you {God’s law}, you approve of what is superior.<verse eid="ROM 2:18"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 2:19"/>You have even convinced yourselves that you {Jews} are the only ones who can teach those {non-Jewish people} who do not know {about God}. {You are convinced that} only you can enable ignorant people to understand {who God is}.<verse eid="ROM 2:19"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 2:20"/>{You have convinced yourself that} you should instruct people who are foolish. {You have convinced yourself that} you should teach {people who are as ignorant as} infants. {You think this way} because you know the laws {God gave the Jews}, which fully contain what we can know and what is true.<verse eid="ROM 2:20"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 2:21"/>So {even though you Jews have convinced yourself that these things are true}, you should teach yourselves to do what you teach others to do {because you don’t do those things}! You keep telling others that they should not steal, but you steal!<verse eid="ROM 2:21"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 2:22"/>You keep telling {people} not to have sexual relations with people whom they did not marry, {but} you do so! You {supposedly} detest idols, {but} you ransack temples {that contain idols}!<verse eid="ROM 2:22"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 2:23"/>You brag about {how well you understand} the laws {God gave you}, {but} you disgrace God by disobeying those laws!<verse eid="ROM 2:23"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 2:24"/>{These things are true} because it is what {the prophet Isaiah meant when} he wrote {in the Scriptures}, “The nations say bad things about God because of {how wickedly} you {Jews act}.”<verse eid="ROM 2:24"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 2:25"/>{You Jews who have sinned will be judged} because, being circumcised {only} benefits you if you obey the laws {God gave you}. However, if you disobey those laws, being circumcised does not benefit you at all.<verse eid="ROM 2:25"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 2:26"/>So then, if uncircumcised people obey what God requires in the laws {he gave the Jews}, God will regard those uncircumcised people as being circumcised.<verse eid="ROM 2:26"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 2:27"/>And people who are physically uncircumcised yet fully obey the laws {from God} will judge you {Jews}! Although {you know} the written rules {God gave the Jews} and you are circumcised, you have disobeyed those laws!<verse eid="ROM 2:27"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 2:28"/>{This is true} because a {true} Jew is not someone who does Jewish rituals that people can see. {Similarly,} people cannot see {true} circumcision on a person’s body.<verse eid="ROM 2:28"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 2:29"/>Rather, a {true} Jew is one {by means of something} that people cannot see. {True} circumcision {happens} in a person’s mind {and} the {Holy} Spirit does it. {Obeying} the written rules {God gave the Jews} cannot do it. God commends a true Jew, but other people do not.<verse eid="ROM 2:29"/></para>
<chapter eid="ROM 2"/>
<chapter number="3" style="c" sid="ROM 3"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 3:1"/>{You Jews might say,} {“If what you have said is true,} then surely being a Jew is not advantageous! Surely being circumcised is not beneficial at all!”<verse eid="ROM 3:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 3:2"/>{Then I would say, “Being a Jew benefits a person} in many ways!” {This is} certainly {true} because, first of all, God trusted the Jews with preserving what he had said {in the Scriptures}.<verse eid="ROM 3:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 3:3"/>{So you might say,} “Some of these {Jews} were certainly unfaithful {to God}! How unfaithful those people are certainly cannot invalidate how faithful God is!”<verse eid="ROM 3:3"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 3:4"/>{Then I would say,} “Of course not!” On the contrary, God {is always} truthful, but everyone else is not. This is what {David meant when} he wrote {in the Scriptures}, “The result {of my sin} is that people will acknowledge that you{, God,} are right when you speak and victorious when people {try to} judge you.”<verse eid="ROM 3:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 3:5"/>But {you might say,} “Suppose {this is true and} how unrighteous we {Jews} are {actually} confirms how righteous God is. {That} could not {possibly mean} that God is unrighteous because he punishes {us}!” (When I talk like this, I am expressing how human beings think.)<verse eid="ROM 3:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 3:6"/>{Then I would say,} “Of course not! If God were unrighteous when he punishes us, then he could not {possibly} judge {anyone in} the world!”<verse eid="ROM 3:6"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 3:7"/>But {then you might say,} “Suppose {this is true, and} my lying further glorifies God {and} how truthful he is. {If that is so,} then {surely} God should not still judge me as if I were sinning!<verse eid="ROM 3:7"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 3:8"/>And {if this is true, then} you should {just} tell us to act wickedly in order that good things can happen!” (This is exactly what some people say falsely about me and claim that I say. It is right {for God} to condemn people {who speak and act} this way!)<verse eid="ROM 3:8"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 3:9"/>{You Jews might then say,} {“If what you have said is true,} then we are surely not superior {to non-Jewish people}!” {And I would say that} indeed we are not. {I say this} because I have previously charged that all Jews and non-Jewish people cannot stop being sinful.<verse eid="ROM 3:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 3:10"/>This is what {the prophets meant when} they wrote {in the Scriptures}, “No one is righteous, no one at all!”<verse eid="ROM 3:10"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 3:11"/>“No one thinks wisely. No one is even trying to know God!<verse eid="ROM 3:11"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 3:12"/>Everyone has refused to obey {God}. As a whole, they are worthless {for doing what God wants}. No one is kind, no one at all!”<verse eid="ROM 3:12"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 3:13"/>“What people say is morally corrupt {like the smell of rotten corpses in} a grave! They constantly deceive {people} by what they say!” “What they say hurts people, like the venom of venomous snakes!”<verse eid="ROM 3:13"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 3:14"/>“They constantly curse {others} and speak harshly {against them}.”<verse eid="ROM 3:14"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 3:15"/>“They rush eagerly to murder people.<verse eid="ROM 3:15"/></para>

<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 3:19"/>Certainly, we Jews know all that God says in his laws applies to {the Jews,} to whom God gave his laws. This is in order that no one can excuse themselves {from being judged by God.} {This is} also in order that God can justly punish everyone in the world as guilty.<verse eid="ROM 3:19"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 3:20"/>{This is true} because God will not make anyone righteous with himself {simply} because they obey the laws {he gave the Jews}. {This is so} because those laws {only} make people aware of how sinful they are.<verse eid="ROM 3:20"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 3:21"/>But now God has revealed how he makes people righteous. {Becoming righteous} is not related to obeying the laws {God gave the Jews}. {Yet,} in what they wrote {in the Scriptures} Moses and the prophets testify {about how God makes people righteous}.<verse eid="ROM 3:21"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 3:22"/>How God makes people righteous is by trusting in Jesus the Messiah. {God will make} all {types of} people {righteous} if they trust in {Jesus}. {This is} because God does not distinguish {between different types of people}.<verse eid="ROM 3:22"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 3:23"/>{This is} because all {types of} people sin and fail to acquire the glorious status from God.<verse eid="ROM 3:23"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 3:24"/>God makes {these sinful people} righteous as a gift because he is so kind. {People receive this gift from God} when God unites them to Jesus the Messiah, who redeemed them {from being punished for being sinful}.<verse eid="ROM 3:24"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 3:25"/>God offered Jesus as the one who atones {for everyone’s sins}. {People are rescued from being punished for being sinful} by trusting in his {sacrificial} death. {God did this} in order to show how God makes people righteous. {This happened} because God disregarded people’s sinful acts that they had previously done.<verse eid="ROM 3:25"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 3:26"/>{God did this} because he is so tolerant. {God also did this} in order to show how he makes people righteous during our time. {This is} for the purpose of showing that God is righteous and that he makes people righteous {if} they trust in Jesus.<verse eid="ROM 3:26"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 3:27"/>{You Jews might say,} {“If what you have said is true,} then surely no one can boast!” {Then I would say,} “Indeed, no one can!” {Then you might say,} “Surely {we can become righteous} by obeying the laws {God gave the Jews}! Surely doing {those things} {will make us righteous}!” {Then I would say,} “Absolutely not! On the contrary, {people become righteous} by trusting {in Jesus the Messiah}.<verse eid="ROM 3:27"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 3:28"/>Indeed, we {Jewish Christians} consider people to become righteous by trusting {in Jesus the Messiah}. {Being righteous} is not related to doing those things {that God commanded} in the laws {he gave the Jews}.”<verse eid="ROM 3:28"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 3:29"/>{Or you might say,} “Surely God is not only the God of the Jews. Surely he is the God of {all} the nations too!” {So I would say,} “Absolutely! He is the God of {all} the nations too.<verse eid="ROM 3:29"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v" sid="ROM 3:30"/>{This is true} because there is certainly {only} one God {for all people}. He will make righteous {both} the Jews who trust {in Jesus} and the non-Jewish people who trust in {Jesus}.”<verse eid="ROM 3:30"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v" sid="ROM 3:31"/>{You Jews might say,} “Then surely we make the laws {God gave us} invalid by trusting in {Jesus}!” {So I would say,} “Of course not! On the contrary, we confirm that {what God said in} those laws is valid.”<verse eid="ROM 3:31"/></para>

<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 4:1"/>{You Jews might say,} {“If what you have said is true,} then surely our physical ancestor Abraham found out {about it}.<verse eid="ROM 4:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 4:2"/>{This must be true} because if Abraham became righteous based on doing the things {that God commanded in his laws}, then he could brag {about it}.” On the contrary, {I would say that} {Abraham could} not possibly {boast about it} to God!<verse eid="ROM 4:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 4:3"/>{I say this} because, {Moses} surely tells {us} in the Scriptures, “Abraham trusted in God, and God considered Abraham to be righteous because he trusted in him.”<verse eid="ROM 4:3"/></para>

<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 8:2"/>{This is true} because the principle that pertains to the life-giving Holy Spirit has caused you {believers} to no longer be controlled by the principle that causes people to sin and die {eternally}. {It did this} by uniting you with the Messiah Jesus.<verse eid="ROM 8:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 8:3"/>Indeed, God {accomplished} what the laws {he gave the Jews} could not accomplish, because they could not prevent people from living sinfully. Through {the crucifying of} {his Son’s} body, God removed {how} sinning {controls people}. {He did this} by sending his own Son {Jesus} {to the world} in a human body {that was} like the bodies of sinful people. {God sent his Son} in order to {remove} that which causes man to sin.<verse eid="ROM 8:3"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 8:4"/>{God did these things} so that we {believers} could do the righteous acts that the laws {he gave the Jews} required. We can live as people whom living sinfully does not control. Rather, {we can live as people} whom the {Holy} Spirit controls.<verse eid="ROM 8:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 8:5"/>{This is true} because those {people} whom living sinfully controls think about those things that are related to living sinfully. However, those people whom the {Holy} Spirit controls think about those things that are related to the {Holy} Spirit.<verse eid="ROM 8:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 8:6"/>Indeed, focusing on living sinfully will cause {a person} to die {eternally}. However, focusing on the {Holy} Spirit will cause {a person} to live {eternally and} peacefully.<verse eid="ROM 8:6"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 8:7"/>{This is true} because {people} who focus on living sinfully are God’s enemies. {This is} because they do not voluntarily obey the laws God gave {the Jews}; they are incapable {of doing so}.<verse eid="ROM 8:7"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 8:8"/>But those whom living sinfully controls are incapable of pleasing God.<verse eid="ROM 8:8"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 8:9"/>By contrast, you {believers} are not those whom living sinfully controls. Rather, you are those whom the {Holy} Spirit controls because God’s Spirit really does reside within you. But if some person does not possess Jesus the Messiah’s Spirit, this person does not belong to the Messiah.<verse eid="ROM 8:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 8:10"/>Now, since the Messiah resides within you {believers}, the {Holy} Spirit gives {you} {eternal} life because he has made you righteous. {This is true} even though your bodies will die because you sin.<verse eid="ROM 8:10"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 8:11"/>The {Holy} Spirit does indeed reside within you. {He came} from God, who caused Jesus to become alive again after he had died. {Since this is true,} God, who caused the Messiah Jesus to become alive again after he had died, will also cause your physical bodies to become alive {again} by his Spirit. This {Spirit} resides within you.<verse eid="ROM 8:11"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 8:12"/>Therefore, {my} fellow believers, we are obligated. {But we are not obligated} to live sinfully, {which means} to live like those whom living sinfully controls.<verse eid="ROM 8:12"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 8:13"/>Indeed, if you live like those whom living sinfully controls, you will die {eternally}. However, if the {Holy} Spirit enables you to stop doing what is sinful with your bodies, you will live {eternally}.<verse eid="ROM 8:13"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 8:14"/>{This is} because those people whom God’s Spirit guides are God’s {spiritual} children.<verse eid="ROM 8:14"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 8:15"/>Indeed, God has not given you {believers} an enslaved mind to terrify you, such as you had before. Rather, God has given you the Holy Spirit to {spiritually} adopt you {as his children}. {It is} the Holy Spirit who enables us to cry out, “Abba, my Father!”<verse eid="ROM 8:15"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 8:16"/>The {Holy} Spirit personally testifies, along with our own minds, that we are God’s {spiritual} children.<verse eid="ROM 8:16"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 8:17"/>Since we are {God’s spiritual} children, we are also those who will inherit {blessings from God}. We inherit {blessings from God himself} and also together with the Messiah {Jesus}. {This is true} only if we keep suffering together with the Messiah in order for God to also glorify us together with the Messiah.<verse eid="ROM 8:17"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 8:18"/>Indeed, I regard what we {believers in the Messiah} suffer at this time as being incomparable to what glorious things God will reveal to us {in the future}.<verse eid="ROM 8:18"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 8:19"/>Indeed, what God created is very eagerly waiting for {the time} when God reveals whom his {spiritual} children are.<verse eid="ROM 8:19"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 8:20"/>{This is} because God subjugated what he created so that it became useless. {What God created} did not want this to happen. Rather, {God subjugated what he created} because he wanted to {do so}. {He did this} to keep {the creation} confidently expecting<verse eid="ROM 8:20"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 8:21"/>that God would also enable what he created to stop decaying and let it freely experience the same glorious status that belongs to his {spiritual} children.<verse eid="ROM 8:21"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 8:22"/>Indeed, we are aware that, {even} at the present time, everything God has created keeps groaning and suffering together {like a mother experiencing pain before bearing a child}.<verse eid="ROM 8:22"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 8:23"/>{It is} not only {what God created that groans}! On the contrary, even we ourselves who possess the {Holy} Spirit as the first portion {from God} feel suffering. {We feel this way} while we eagerly wait for God to {spiritually} adopt us, which will be when God redeems our bodies.<verse eid="ROM 8:23"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 8:24"/>{This is so} because God rescued us while we confidently expect this. If we {already} had what we have been confidently expecting, then we would have nothing to confidently expect. {This is} because surely nobody confidently expects something that he {already} has.<verse eid="ROM 8:24"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 8:25"/>Yet, if we keep on confidently expecting what we do not yet have, then we will keep on eagerly waiting for it while persevering.<verse eid="ROM 8:25"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 8:26"/>The {Holy} Spirit similarly also assists us because we are weak. {This is} because we are not aware for what we should pray. However, the {Holy} Spirit personally pleads on our behalf by groaning without speaking words.<verse eid="ROM 8:26"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 8:27"/>Now God is the one who investigates what we think and feel. He is aware of what the {Holy} Spirit intends, because the Spirit pleads for the sake of God’s people according to {what} God {wants}.<verse eid="ROM 8:27"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 8:28"/>We are certain that God makes all things that happen to benefit those who love him. {They are} the people whom God called because he previously planned {to do so}.<verse eid="ROM 8:28"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 8:29"/>{This is} because those whom God chose in advance, he also decided in advance to make resemble his Son {Jesus}. {God did these things} in order for his Son {Jesus} to have first place among many {spiritual} siblings.<verse eid="ROM 8:29"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v" sid="ROM 8:30"/>Certainly, the people whom God chose in advance {to become his people}, he also summoned to become his people. And those people whom God summoned {to become his people}, he also made righteous. And those people whom God made righteous, he will also make glorious.<verse eid="ROM 8:30"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v" sid="ROM 8:31"/>{Since these things are true,} then we should say this about them: since God supports us, surely no one {is powerful enough} to oppose us!<verse eid="ROM 8:31"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="32" style="v" sid="ROM 8:32"/>God did not even spare his own Son, {Jesus}. On the contrary, God handed him over {to die} for the sake of us all. So God surely will also graciously give us, along with Jesus, every {blessing}!<verse eid="ROM 8:32"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="33" style="v" sid="ROM 8:33"/>Surely no one can {rightly} accuse those whom God chose {to become his people}! {This is because} God is the one who makes people righteous.<verse eid="ROM 8:33"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="34" style="v" sid="ROM 8:34"/>Surely no one can condemn {God’s people}! {This is because} the Messiah Jesus is the one who died. Furthermore, he is the one whom God made alive again. He is also at the place of highest honor next to God, and he even pleads for our sake.<verse eid="ROM 8:34"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="35" style="v" sid="ROM 8:35"/>Surely no one can make Jesus stop loving us! If people trouble us or distress us or persecute us, or if we are hungry or naked or in danger, or if people kill us with swords, surely none of those things can make Jesus stop loving us!<verse eid="ROM 8:35"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="36" style="v" sid="ROM 8:36"/>This is what {God meant when} he said {in the Scriptures}, “They constantly kill us because of you{, God}. They consider us to be like sheep for them to slaughter.”<verse eid="ROM 8:36"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="37" style="v" sid="ROM 8:37"/>However, he who loved us enables us to completely overcome all of these things {that might happen to us}.<verse eid="ROM 8:37"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="38" style="v" sid="ROM 8:38"/>In fact, God has persuaded me that {none of these things}—whether being dead, or what happens while we are alive, or angels, or demons who rule, or things that are happening to us, or things that will happen to us, or powerful demons,<verse eid="ROM 8:38"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="39" style="v" sid="ROM 8:39"/>or what is above {us}, or what is below {us}, or anything else that God created—can stop God from loving us! {God loves us} because we are united to the Messiah Jesus, our Lord!<verse eid="ROM 8:39"/></para>
<chapter eid="ROM 8"/>
<chapter number="9" style="c" sid="ROM 9"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 9:1"/>I speak what is true as one whom God has united with the Messiah. I do not speak what is false. The Holy Spirit confirms what my conscience testifies within myself {when I say}<verse eid="ROM 9:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 9:2"/>that I grieve very greatly and constantly!<verse eid="ROM 9:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 9:3"/>{I do so} because I truly wish that God would curse me and completely alienate me from {Jesus} the Messiah for my fellow {kinsmen} {to be saved}! They are physically related to me.<verse eid="ROM 9:3"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 9:4"/>These {kinsmen of mine} are the Israelites. {They are those} whom God {spiritually} adopted. God allowed them to experience how glorious he is. God made covenants with them. God gave them his laws. God gave them the way to worship him. God also made promises to them.<verse eid="ROM 9:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 9:5"/>{Our Jewish} forefathers {Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob} were Israelites. The Messiah is also one of them, as someone physically related to them. The Messiah rules over everything. {He is} the blessed God forever. May it be so!<verse eid="ROM 9:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 9:6"/>Yet God has not failed to do what he promised {to the Israelites}. {This is true} because not all people who have physically descended from Israel are {true} Israelites.<verse eid="ROM 9:6"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 9:7"/>{It is} also not {true} that all those who physically descended {from Abraham} are Abraham’s {true} offspring. Rather, {as God says to Abraham in the Scriptures,} “I will identify your {true} offspring through {those who descend from} Isaac.”<verse eid="ROM 9:7"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 9:8"/>In other words, the people who {only} physically descended {from Abraham} are not God’s {spiritual} children. Rather, those {who became God’s spiritual} children as a result of what God promised are regarded as {Abraham’s true spiritual} offspring.<verse eid="ROM 9:8"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 9:9"/>Indeed, this is what God promised {would happen} {when he said in the Scriptures}, “At a set time, I will come. As a result, Sarah will give birth to a son.”<verse eid="ROM 9:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 9:10"/>This is not the only {promise God made}. But {God made a promise} also when Rebekah became pregnant by this same man, Isaac. {He is} the ancestor of us {Israelites}.<verse eid="ROM 9:10"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 9:11"/>Indeed, {God chose only one of her two sons} even though she had not yet born them and they had not yet done anything right or wrong. {God did this} in order that what he had previously planned with regard to choosing {people} would happen.<verse eid="ROM 9:11"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 9:12"/>{God did not choose only one of her sons} because of what he did. Rather, it was because God summons {those whom he chooses}. {This is why} God told Rebekah {in the Scriptures}, “Your older son will become a slave to your younger son.”<verse eid="ROM 9:12"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 9:13"/>This is what {God meant when} he said {in the Scriptures}, “I love {the younger son} Jacob, but I emphatically reject {the older son} Esau.”<verse eid="ROM 9:13"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 9:14"/>{Someone might say,} {“If what you have said is true,} then surely God must be unrighteous!” {Then I would say,} “Of course not!”<verse eid="ROM 9:14"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 9:15"/>{We know that God is truly righteous} because God told Moses {in the Scriptures}, “I will be merciful to whomever I want to be merciful. I will be compassionate to whomever I want to be compassionate.”<verse eid="ROM 9:15"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 9:16"/>Therefore, {who receives God’s mercy does} not {depend} on {how much} someone desires {to receive it}. {Who receives God’s mercy} also does not depend on {how much} effort someone exerts. Rather, {it depends on} what God wants. {He is} the one who is merciful.<verse eid="ROM 9:16"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 9:17"/>Indeed, this is what God told Pharaoh in the Scriptures, “I allowed you {to become king in Egypt} for this exact reason: in order that I could use you to exhibit how powerful I am. I also {allowed you to become king} in order that I will be famous all over the world.”<verse eid="ROM 9:17"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 9:18"/>Therefore, God is merciful to whomever he wants {to be merciful}. But he makes stubborn whomever he wants {to become stubborn}.<verse eid="ROM 9:18"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 9:19"/>As a result {of what I have said,} one of you may tell me, “{If what you have said is true,} then surely God should not blame people {for doing what they do}! {God should not do that} because no one can ever stop him from doing whatever he wants {to do}!”<verse eid="ROM 9:19"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 9:20"/>{Then I would say,} “You {mere} human! You who argue with God are truly not worthy {to do so}! Who God has made surely must not say to God who made him, ‘You should not have made me to be like this!’”<verse eid="ROM 9:20"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 9:21"/>{God can surely do whatever he wants to do with what he has made. In the same way,} someone who makes containers can do whatever he wants to do with his materials. From the same material he can make both containers for special use and containers for ordinary use.<verse eid="ROM 9:21"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 9:22"/>Now, {you should surely not argue with God} because he very patiently endured those people whom he would punish {and} had prepared to destroy {eternally}. {He endured them} because he wanted to show how angry he is and to reveal how powerful he is.<verse eid="ROM 9:22"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 9:23"/>{God} also {endures those whom he will punish} in order to reveal how abundantly glorious he is to those people to whom he will be merciful. God has previously arranged to glorify these people {eternally}.<verse eid="ROM 9:23"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 9:24"/>We are also {among those people to whom God is merciful and} whom God has summoned. {God summons people} from {among} Jewish people and even from {among} non-Jewish people.<verse eid="ROM 9:24"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 9:25"/>In the same way, God also told Hosea {in the Scriptures}, “I will give the name ‘My people’ to people who were not my people. I will also give the name ‘Loved one’ to the person whom I did not love.”<verse eid="ROM 9:25"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 9:26"/>{God also told Hosea,} “Then it will happen, in the {exact} same location where I previously told them, ‘You are not my people,’ I will give them the name, ‘Children of God who lives.’”<verse eid="ROM 9:26"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 9:27"/>Indeed, {elsewhere in the Scriptures} Isaiah shouts out about {the people} of Israel, “Even though there were as many Israelites as there are grains of sand along the seashore, God will refrain from punishing {only} a few of them.<verse eid="ROM 9:27"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 9:28"/>{This is} because the Lord will fully and swiftly accomplish what he promised {to do} on the earth.”<verse eid="ROM 9:28"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 9:29"/>{It is} also just like Isaiah previously said {in the Scriptures}, “Unless the Lord, who rules over angel armies, had preserved offspring for us {Israelites}, he would have utterly destroyed us like he destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.”<verse eid="ROM 9:29"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v" sid="ROM 9:30"/>{Since these things are true}, we should surely say that {although} the nations are not trying to be righteous, {they} became righteous. {However,} they became righteous by trusting {God}.<verse eid="ROM 9:30"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v" sid="ROM 9:31"/>By contrast, {the people of} Israel tried to obey the laws {God gave them} in order to become righteous. {But} they could not become righteous by {obeying} those laws.<verse eid="ROM 9:31"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="32" style="v" sid="ROM 9:32"/>The reason why {the people of Israel could not become righteous} is that they did not {try to become righteous} by trusting {God}. Instead, they tried to become righteous by working {for it}. {Because of this} {the Messiah offended them when he came}. It is as if the Messiah is} a stone that causes them to trip.<verse eid="ROM 9:32"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="33" style="v" sid="ROM 9:33"/>This is what {God meant when} he had {Isaiah} write {in the Scriptures}, “Pay attention! I am placing in Jerusalem {someone who is like} a stone that trips {people} and a rock that offends {people}. But God will not humiliate {anyone} who trusts in that person.”<verse eid="ROM 9:33"/></para>

<chapter number="10" style="c" sid="ROM 10"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 10:1"/>My fellow believers, I strongly desire {that God will save the Israelites}. I also pray for him {to save} them!<verse eid="ROM 10:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 10:2"/>{This is} because I personally confirm that they are zealous about God. However, {they are} not {zealous} based on fully knowing {God}.<verse eid="ROM 10:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 10:3"/>{This is} because they are not aware of how God makes people righteous, and they try to make themselves righteous. {This is why} they refuse to subject themselves to the way God makes people righteous.<verse eid="ROM 10:3"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 10:4"/>{They were wrong to try to make themselves righteous}, because {Jesus} the Messiah has ended the laws {that God gave the Jews}. {Christ did this} in order for God to make righteous anyone who trusts {in Jesus}.<verse eid="ROM 10:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 10:5"/>Indeed, this is what Moses wrote {in the Scriptures} about being righteous by {obeying} the laws {God gave the Jews}: “The person who obeys {all} {God’s} laws {perfectly} will live {eternally} by doing so.”<verse eid="ROM 10:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 10:6"/>However, this is what {Moses} said {in the Scriptures} about people becoming righteous by trusting {in God}, “Do not say to yourselves, ‘Surely no one can go up to heaven!’” (This refers to trying to make the Messiah come down {to the earth}.)<verse eid="ROM 10:6"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 10:7"/>{Moses} also {said not to say,} “Surely no one can go down into the bottomless pit!” (This refers to trying to make the Messiah become alive again after he had died.)<verse eid="ROM 10:7"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 10:8"/>However, {Moses also} said this {in the Scriptures} {about people becoming righteous by trusting in God}, “You can easily know what God said. You can proclaim it and know it personally.” This refers to what God said about trusting {in him}. {This is what} we {believers in the Messiah} keep announcing.<verse eid="ROM 10:8"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 10:9"/>{What we keep announcing is} that God will save {any of} you who verbally acknowledges that Jesus is the Lord {over all things} and {personally} trusts that God made Jesus become alive again after he had died.<verse eid="ROM 10:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 10:10"/>{This is true} because God makes righteous anyone who personally trusts {in Jesus}, and he saves anyone who verbally acknowledges {that Jesus is the Lord}.<verse eid="ROM 10:10"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 10:11"/>Indeed, this is {what God} said in the Scriptures, “God will not humiliate {anyone} who trusts in that person.”<verse eid="ROM 10:11"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 10:12"/>Indeed, the Lord {Jesus} does not discriminate between Jewish people and non-Jewish people. {This is} because {Jesus} is the same Lord {who rules} over everyone. He generously blesses all people who call out to him {to save them}.<verse eid="ROM 10:12"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 10:13"/>Indeed, {Joel wrote in the Scriptures,} “God will save all people who call out to the Lord {to save them}.”<verse eid="ROM 10:13"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 10:14"/>So, people certainly will not call out {for the Lord Jesus to save them} {if} they do not trust {in him}. And people certainly will not trust {in Jesus} {if} they have not heard {about him}. And people certainly will not hear {about Jesus} {if} someone does not proclaim {to them who he is}.<verse eid="ROM 10:14"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 10:15"/>And certainly people would not proclaim {to other people who Jesus is} unless someone sends them out! This is what {Isaiah meant when} he wrote {in the Scriptures}, “It is a beautiful thing when people go and declare {to other people} the good news about good things!”<verse eid="ROM 10:15"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 10:16"/>However, not all {Jews} accepted the good news {about Jesus}. Indeed, this is what Isaiah {meant when} he said {in the Scriptures}, “Lord, no one trusts what we say!”<verse eid="ROM 10:16"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 10:17"/>So then, {a person can only} trust {in Jesus} by hearing {about him}. And {a person can only} hear {about Jesus} through {hearing} the message {that is about} the Messiah.<verse eid="ROM 10:17"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 10:18"/>However, this is what I say, “The Jews most definitely heard {the message}!” It is a fact. {As David wrote in the Scriptures,} “{The heavenly bodies are like witnesses and} everyone throughout the entire world could hear what they said.”<verse eid="ROM 10:18"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 10:19"/>This is also what I say, “{The people of} Israel most definitely understood {the message}!” {God} first said through Moses {in the Scriptures}, “I will {personally} make you envious and angry by {using} a nation that does not {belong to me} and does not {even} know {me}.”<verse eid="ROM 10:19"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 10:20"/>Moreover, {God} quite boldly declared through Isaiah {in the Scriptures}, “I revealed myself to those {non-Jewish people} who were not interested in knowing me and did not {even} ask about me.”<verse eid="ROM 10:20"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 10:21"/>However, {God} told {the people of} Israel {in the Scriptures}, “I am always inviting {you} to know me, {but you} {constantly} disobey and oppose {me}!”<verse eid="ROM 10:21"/></para>

<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 11:1"/>Since {these things are true}, this is what I say, “God certainly has not rejected his people, the Israelites!” Of course not! {I know this is true} because I too am one of the Israelites. I descended from Abraham. {More specifically, I descended} from the tribe that descended from Benjamin.<verse eid="ROM 11:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 11:2"/>God did not discard his people. {They are the people} whom he chose in advance. You certainly are aware of what the Prophet Elijah said in the Scriptures when he appealed to God against the people of Israel!<verse eid="ROM 11:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 11:3"/>{Elijah said,} “Lord, the people of Israel murdered {all of} your prophets {except for me}! They demolished {all of} your altars! I am the very last {prophet} who is still alive! Now, they are trying to kill me {too}!”<verse eid="ROM 11:3"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 11:4"/>However, this is how God replied to Elijah, “I have kept alive 7,000 men for my purposes. These men have not worshipped {the false god} Baal.”<verse eid="ROM 11:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 11:5"/>So, similarly, at this time some faithful Israelites also remain. {This is} because God has graciously chosen them {to remain}.<verse eid="ROM 11:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 11:6"/>Yet because {God chooses his people} based on how gracious he is, {God} does not {choose his people} based on what they do. {If God chose people based on what they do,} then how gracious he is would not {really} be gracious.<verse eid="ROM 11:6"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 11:7"/>So this is what we should conclude: Although {the people of} Israel keep trying to make themselves righteous, they cannot do so. Instead, those whom God {graciously} chose {from them} became righteous. But God made stubborn those people of Israel whom he did not {graciously} choose.<verse eid="ROM 11:7"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 11:8"/>This is exactly {what God meant when he wrote} in the Scriptures, “God caused the people of Israel to not think properly. Until this present day, God has made them completely unable to understand {how to become righteous}.”<verse eid="ROM 11:8"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 11:9"/>David also stated {in the Scriptures}, “{O God}, make the luxurious way they live punish them completely {like a hunter catches an animal} in a net or trap! {Make the luxurious way they live} cause them to sin and pay them back {for sinning}!<verse eid="ROM 11:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 11:10"/>Make them unable to understand! Make them suffer like slaves forever!”<verse eid="ROM 11:10"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" sid="ROM 11:11"/>Since {these things are true}, this is what I say, “The Jewish people were certainly not offended in order that God would completely reject them!” Of course not! Rather, God saves non-Jewish people because the Jewish people disobeyed {him}. This happened in order for God to make the Jewish people envious {of non-Jewish people who know him}.<verse eid="ROM 11:11"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 11:12"/>Indeed, God used how the Jewish people disobeyed {him and} failed {to make themselves righteous} to abundantly bless people from all the nations in the whole world. So, {when} the complete amount of {faithful} Jewish people {become righteous}, there will be even greater blessings!<verse eid="ROM 11:12"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 11:13"/>But now I am speaking to you {non-Jewish people who trust in Jesus}. God indeed made me his representative to non-Jewish people. Therefore, I show how glorious is what I do to minister {to non-Jewish people}.<verse eid="ROM 11:13"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 11:14"/>If possible, I want to make those who I am physically related to, the Jews, envious {of the non-Jewish people who know God}, so that God will save some of them.<verse eid="ROM 11:14"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 11:15"/>Indeed, God is reconciling with {people in} the world as a result of him rejecting the Jewish people. So, when God accepts the Jewish people, it will result in God making alive those who are dead.<verse eid="ROM 11:15"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 11:16"/>Indeed, because {the ancestors of the Jewish people belong to God, just like} the first portion {of a lump of dough} belongs to God, {all the Jewish people belong to God, just like} that whole lump of dough {belongs to God}. Also, because {the ancestors of the Jewish people belonged to God, just like} the root {of an olive tree} belongs to God, {all the Jewish people belong to God, just like} the branches of that {same} tree {belong to God}.<verse eid="ROM 11:16"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" sid="ROM 11:17"/>Indeed, {God has removed some of the Jewish people from his people, as} a farmer breaks {unfruitful} branches off {of an olive tree}. But, {God has made} you {non-Jewish people who trust in Jesus} {part of his people, as} a farmer grafts wild olive branches into {a cultivated tree}. {You} also {share together in benefitting from being part of God‘s people, as} grafted branches share in the nutrition in the olive tree root.<verse eid="ROM 11:17"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" sid="ROM 11:18"/>Therefore, you {non-Jewish people who trust in Jesus} must not boast against the {Jewish people whom God removed, even though they are like} broken off branches! If you do boast, {you must realize that} you indeed do not sustain the Jewish people. Rather, {they sustain} you, as the root sustains {the branches}!<verse eid="ROM 11:18"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 11:19"/>So then, you might say, “{God removed some of the Jewish people from his people, as} a farmer breaks {unfruitful} branches off {of a tree}. {God did this} in order that {he could join} me {to his people, as} a farmer grafts a branch into {a tree}.”<verse eid="ROM 11:19"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 11:20"/>{I would reply by saying that} what you said is correct. {God removed} some of the Jewish people {from being his people, as} a farmer breaks off {unfruitful} branches because they were unfaithful. However, you {non-Jewish people who trust in Jesus} remain {part of God‘s people} by trusting {in him}. Do not arrogantly think {that you are better than unbelieving Jewish people}! Rather, fear {God!}<verse eid="ROM 11:20"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" sid="ROM 11:21"/>{You should fear God} because he did not show pity to the {faithless Jewish people, who are like} natural branches. So, he will not show pity to you {non-Jewish people} {if you stop trusting in Jesus}!<verse eid="ROM 11:21"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" sid="ROM 11:22"/>Since {this is true}, pay attention to how kind and severe God can be! God acts severely toward those who stop trusting in him. However, God will act kindly toward you {non-Jewish people who trust in Jesus} if you continue accepting how kind he is. But, if you do not {do this}, {God will reject you, like} a farmer cuts an {unfruitful} branch off of a tree!<verse eid="ROM 11:22"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" sid="ROM 11:23"/>However, if those faithless Jewish people believe {in Jesus}, God will allow them to {rejoin his people, just as} a farmer grafts {branches} into {a tree}. {This is} because God is powerful enough to rejoin the Jewish people {to his people}.<verse eid="ROM 11:23"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" sid="ROM 11:24"/>Indeed, {God removed} you {non-Jewish people who trust in Jesus from the nations and joined you to his people, as} a farmer cuts off a branch from a naturally wild olive tree and grafts it into a cultivated olive tree, {even though doing so is} not natural. Since {this is true}, {God} will certainly {join Israelites back into his people, just as} a farmer grafts a naturally cultivated olive branch back into its own tree.<verse eid="ROM 11:24"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" sid="ROM 11:25"/>{I say this} because I really want you, my {non-Jewish} fellow believers, to know what God had previously hidden {from people}, so that you do not become arrogant. {God had previously hidden from people the fact} that some of {the people of} Israel will stubbornly oppose {him} until all the non-Jewish people God has chosen have joined his people.<verse eid="ROM 11:25"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" sid="ROM 11:26"/>Then, in the same way, God will save all {of the people of} Israel. This is what {Isaiah meant when} he wrote {in the Scriptures}, “God will send from Jerusalem someone to rescue {his people}. {That man} will make {the descendants of} Jacob stop being ungodly.”<verse eid="ROM 11:26"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" sid="ROM 11:27"/>{God says,} “This is the agreement that I will make with the descendants of Jacob, when I forgive {them for the} sinful things {that they have done}.”<verse eid="ROM 11:27"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" sid="ROM 11:28"/>With regard to {Jewish people rejecting} the good news, they are enemies {of God} for your benefit. However, with regard to {God} choosing {Jewish people}, God loves them for the sake of {what he promised} their ancestors.<verse eid="ROM 11:28"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" sid="ROM 11:29"/>{This is true} because God does not revoke the things he graciously gives. {He} also {does not revoke} {the people whom} he summons {to be his people}.<verse eid="ROM 11:29"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v" sid="ROM 11:30"/>Indeed, {it is} just as you {non-Jewish people who trust in Jesus} used to disobey God, but now God has been merciful to you because the Jewish people disobeyed {him}.<verse eid="ROM 11:30"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v" sid="ROM 11:31"/>In the same way, the Jewish people also are now disobeying {God} because God has been merciful to you {non-Jewish people}. {This happened} in order for God to now also be merciful to them.<verse eid="ROM 11:31"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="32" style="v" sid="ROM 11:32"/>Indeed, God allowed everyone to disobey him in order to be merciful to them.<verse eid="ROM 11:32"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="33" style="v" sid="ROM 11:33"/>God is so very wealthy, wise, and knowledgeable! No one can fully understand what he does!<verse eid="ROM 11:33"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="34" style="v" sid="ROM 11:34"/>Indeed, {as Isaiah wrote,} “{No one} could {ever} comprehend what the Lord thinks or advise him!”<verse eid="ROM 11:34"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="35" style="v" sid="ROM 11:35"/>Furthermore, “No one could {ever} give God {anything} that would cause God to owe him {something}!”<verse eid="ROM 11:35"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="36" style="v" sid="ROM 11:36"/>{No one can do these things}, because everything {came} from God, {exists} by God, and {exists} for God. {I pray that} everyone will glorify him forever. May this truly be so!<verse eid="ROM 11:36"/></para>
<chapter eid="ROM 11"/>
<chapter number="12" style="c" sid="ROM 12"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 12:1"/>So then, {considering everything that I have told you,} I exhort you fellow believers, based on how compassionate God is: Devote yourselves {to God}, as if you were living animals someone offers to God. Be holy and please God. Doing so is the reasonable way for you to serve {God}.<verse eid="ROM 12:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 12:2"/>Do not change yourselves to be like the {sinful people who live at} the current time. Rather, let God change the way you behave by changing the way you think in order that you can test and prove what God wants {you to do}. {God wants you to do} what is good, pleasing, and flawless.<verse eid="ROM 12:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 12:3"/>Indeed, based on {how} God has kindly authorized me {to represent him,} I am telling every one of you to not think you are better than you really are. Rather, think properly {about yourselves}, according to the amount of trusting {in God} that God has apportioned to each one {of you}.<verse eid="ROM 12:3"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 12:4"/>{You must think properly about yourselves} because, in the same way that a {human} body has many parts that all function for different purposes,<verse eid="ROM 12:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 12:5"/>so also, we many {believers in the Messiah} are united to the Messiah as one group. {Each one of us is united to each other like} the individual parts {of a human body} are united.<verse eid="ROM 12:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 12:6"/>Yet we {believers in the Messiah} have received different spiritual abilities in accordance with what God has kindly given to us.

<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" sid="ROM 12:19"/>{Fellow believers} whom I love, do not retaliate {when people do something evil against you}. Rather, let God punish {them}. {I say this} because Moses wrote {in the Scriptures}, “The Lord says, ‘I will retaliate {when people do something evil against you}. I will punish {them according to what they have done}.’”<verse eid="ROM 12:19"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" sid="ROM 12:20"/>Rather {than permitting us to retaliate, God instructed us in the Scriptures}, “Feed your enemy if that person is hungry.

<chapter number="13" style="c" sid="ROM 13"/>
<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 13:1"/>Every one of you must submit yourselves to those whom God has authorized to govern you. {This is} because no one {can govern} unless God authorizes them {to do so}. God has instituted the existing governments.<verse eid="ROM 13:1"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 13:2"/>So people who resist those whom God has authorized {to govern} are opposing what God has commanded. God will punish those people who oppose {those whom he has authorized to govern}.<verse eid="ROM 13:2"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 13:3"/>Indeed, the people who rule are {not supposed} to terrify {those people who do} what is good.

<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 13:4"/>{This is} because the people {whom God authorizes to rule} serve God for your benefit. But if you do what is evil, you should be afraid, because God has authorized those people who rule to punish {people} for a good reason. Indeed, those people who rule serve God by avenging {what is evil} in order to punish anyone who practices what is evil.<verse eid="ROM 13:4"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 13:5"/>Consequently, you must submit yourselves {to those people whom God authorizes to rule}. {You must do this} not only because they can punish you, but also because you know {that to disobey them is to disobey God}!<verse eid="ROM 13:5"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" sid="ROM 13:6"/>Indeed, you also pay taxes because of these things. {You also pay taxes} because those people {whom God authorizes to rule} serve God. They devote themselves to serving {by governing}.<verse eid="ROM 13:6"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" sid="ROM 13:7"/>Give to everyone what you owe them: Pay taxes to whom you owe taxes. Pay fees to whom you owe fees. Fear those people whom you should fear. Honor those people whom you should honor.<verse eid="ROM 13:7"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 13:8"/>Do not owe anything to anyone. Rather, continue to love other {people who believe in the Messiah} {as if you owe it to them}. {Do this} because someone who loves another person accomplishes {what God required in} the laws {he gave the Jews}.<verse eid="ROM 13:8"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 13:9"/>{This is true} because {God commanded} these things {in his laws when he said}, “Do not have sexual relations with someone whom you did not marry. Do not murder. Do not rob people. Do not lust for what belongs to other people.” You could summarize anything else that God commands {in the laws he gave the Jews} with this {other} thing {God commanded}: “Love other people in the same way you love yourself.”<verse eid="ROM 13:9"/></para>
<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 13:10"/>{When you} love other people, {you} do not do evil things {to them}. This is why loving {other people} accomplishes {what God required in} the laws {he gave the Jews}.<verse eid="ROM 13:10"/></para>

<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 13:12"/>{In the same way that} the night ends just before the day begins{, the time of this sinful world is almost over, and Jesus will return soon}.
