<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" sid="EZK 1:1"/>(1-2) “When I, Ezekiel, was thirty years old, I was living among the Israelite people by the Kebar Canal, which was south of Babylon. The Babylonians had taken us from the land of Judah and brought us here. On the fifth day of the fourth month of that year, it was as though the sky opened and I saw visions from God. The fifth day of the fourth month was almost five years after King Jehoiachin had been exiled.”<verse eid="EZK 1:1"/></para>
