18“Do not let the tribal groups that descended from Kohath die out from among those who descended from Levi.


## Numbers 4:19 (id: 1004004019)

19Rather, in order for those who descended from Kohath to stay alive when they come close to the most sacred items, Aaron and those who descended from him must enter {the Holy Place first} and tell each of those who descended from Kohath what to do and what to carry.


## Numbers 4:20 (id: 1004004020)

20Those who descended from Kohath must not look at anything in the Holy Place, not even briefly, or they will die.”

3You shall certainly remove both male and female Israelites from the campground so that they do not profane the camp, the place where I am among them.”


## Numbers 5:4 (id: 1004005004)

4The Israelites obeyed and removed those who had conditions from the campgrounds. So, the Israelites did exactly what Yahweh said to Moses.


## Numbers 5:5 (id: 1004005005)

5Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 5:6 (id: 1004005006)

6“Say this to the Israelites: ‘When any person is unfaithful to Yahweh and does anything contrary to his commands, that person is guilty.


## Numbers 5:7 (id: 1004005007)

7The guilty person shall confess his sin which he did. Then he shall pay the one against whom he sinned the full price of his sin in addition to one fifth of the full price.


## Numbers 5:8 (id: 1004005008)

8If there is not one whom the guilty person can pay for his sin, the guilty person will give the payment to Yahweh by giving it to the priest. In addition to this payment, the guilty person must also give a ram, which the priest shall sacrifice in order to atone for his sin.


## Numbers 5:9 (id: 1004005009)

9Every payment the Israelites give to the priest, all {of which shall be} holy, shall belong to the priest.

## Numbers 5:11 (id: 1004005011)

11Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 5:12 (id: 1004005012)

12“Say this to the Israelites: ‘If a man’s wife behaves unfaithfully toward her husband by having sexual relations with another man


## Numbers 5:13 (id: 1004005013)

13which her husband and no other person witnesses, which they then keep a secret from everyone so that the Israelites do not discover her sin, she is profaned.


## Numbers 5:14 (id: 1004005014)

14{If} a man develops jealous feelings and suspects his wife of sexual unfaithfulness and she has profaned herself {sexually}, or if a man develops jealous feelings and suspects his wife of sexual unfaithfulness and she has not profaned herself {sexually},


## Numbers 5:15 (id: 1004005015)

15this man shall lead his wife to the priest. He shall also bring one tenth an ephah of barley flour without pouring oil on it or placing frankincense on it, because this offering is a grain offering presented when a man is suspicious of his wife. This grain offering is {to pray that Yahweh would} remember the sin.’


## Numbers 5:16 (id: 1004005016)

16The priest shall call her to himself and {order} her to stand in front of Yahweh.


## Numbers 5:17 (id: 1004005017)

17The priest shall pick up the clay jar with holy water {in it}, pick up dust from the ground of the sacred tent, and he shall mix {the dust with the} holy water {in the clay jar}.


## Numbers 5:18 (id: 1004005018)

18The priest shall {order} the woman to stand in front of Yahweh, unbind the hair of the woman, and place in her hand the grain offering {to pray that God} remembers, which is the grain offering presented when a man suspects his wife of sexual unfaithfulness. The priest shall hold the water mixture in his hand, by which {Yahweh} will curse {the woman with a} bitter {life}.


## Numbers 5:19 (id: 1004005019)

19The priest shall order the wife to swear, and he shall say to the woman, “{Yahweh will not} curse {you with a} bitter {life with} this water mixture if you have not committed adultery nor defiled your {moral} cleanliness while married to your husband.”


## Numbers 5:20 (id: 1004005020)

20(20\-21\) The priest shall order the woman to swear the oath {where she accepts Yahweh’s} curse. The priest shall say to the woman, “However, if you have defiled {yourself sexually} while married to your husband and {if you} have profaned {yourself sexually} by having a man who is not your husband commit adultery with you, Yahweh will curse you and make you an example in the midst of your people by preventing your body from bearing children.


## Numbers 5:22 (id: 1004005022)

22{Yahweh will} curse {you with} this water when it enters your stomach. It will prevent your body from bearing children.” The woman shall say, “I agree completely.”


## Numbers 5:23 (id: 1004005023)

23The priest shall write {the words of} these curses on a scroll, and he shall wash the ink into the water by which {Yahweh will make her life} bitter.


## Numbers 5:24 (id: 1004005024)

24Then, he shall order the woman to drink the water by which {Yahweh will} curse {her by making her life} bitter. She shall swallow the water by which {Yahweh will} curse {her}.


## Numbers 5:25 (id: 1004005025)

25The priest shall take from the woman’s hand the grain offering presented when a man is suspicious of his wife. He shall bring the grain offering close to the altar and dedicate it to Yahweh.


## Numbers 5:26 (id: 1004005026)

26The priest shall take a handful of the grain offering and shall {throw it} in the altar to burn it. Then, he shall order the woman to drink the water.


## Numbers 5:27 (id: 1004005027)

27He shall order the woman to drink the water. When the woman swallows the water by which {Yahweh curses a person with a} bitter {life}, her body will be unable to bear children, and she will become a curse in the midst of her people if she has profaned {herself sexually}, behaving unfaithfully toward her husband.


## Numbers 5:28 (id: 1004005028)

28However, if she has not profaned {herself sexually}, she is {sexually} pure, will be free {from guilt}, and will be able to bear children.


## Numbers 5:29 (id: 1004005029)

29These instructions are the statute of a jealous spirit: when a woman is {sexually} unfaithful to her husband and profaned,


## Numbers 5:30 (id: 1004005030)

30or when a man develops jealous feelings and suspects his wife {of sexual unfaithfulness}, the husband shall lead his wife before Yahweh, and the priest shall do to the wife everything {described in} this statute.


## Numbers 5:31 (id: 1004005031)

31Then, the man will be {morally} free from sin, and his wife will be {morally} guilty.’”


## Numbers 6:1 (id: 1004006001)

1Yahweh also said this to Moses:


## Numbers 6:2 (id: 1004006002)

2“Tell this to the Israelite people: If any of you wants to make a solemn promise to dedicate himself to belong to me in a special way, after you obey these instructions, you will be called a Nazir, which means ‘a dedicated person.’


## Numbers 6:3 (id: 1004006003)

3You must not drink any wine or other alcoholic drink. You must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.


## Numbers 6:4 (id: 1004006004)

4You must not eat anything that comes from grapevines, not even the skins or seeds of grapes, during the time that you are a Nazir.


## Numbers 6:5 (id: 1004006005)

5Even your hair will be dedicated to me during the time that you are a Nazir, so you must never allow anyone to cut your hair. Until the time that your solemn promise to dedicate yourself to me is ended, you must allow your hair to grow long.


## Numbers 6:6 (id: 1004006006)

6And you must not go near a corpse during the time that you are a Nazir.


## Numbers 6:7 (id: 1004006007)

7Even if the person who died is your father or your mother or your brother or your sister, you must not cause yourself to become unacceptable to me by coming close to the corpse. Your long hair shows that you belong to me in a special way, so you must do what you have solemnly promised and not cut your hair.


## Numbers 6:8 (id: 1004006008)

8You are required to keep doing this all the time that you are dedicated to me in this special way.


## Numbers 6:9 (id: 1004006009)

9If anyone dies very suddenly when he is near you, then your hair that you have dedicated to me is no longer sacred. So you must wait seven days and then shave it all off. Then you must perform a special ritual to cause yourself to become acceptable to me again.


## Numbers 6:10 (id: 1004006010)

10The next day you must bring two doves or two pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the sacred tent.


## Numbers 6:11 (id: 1004006011)

11The priest must kill the birds and offer them as sacrifices. One of them will be an offering to take away the guilt of your sin, and the other will be an offering that is burned completely to please me. After the priests burns them on the altar, I will forgive you for having come close to a corpse, and when your hair grows again it will be dedicated to me again.


## Numbers 6:12 (id: 1004006012)

12The amount of time that you were set apart for me the previous time does not count, because you had become unacceptable to me by coming close to a corpse during the time that you were a Nazir. So you must again make a solemn promise to dedicate yourself to me for the entire amount of time that you indicated the previous time. And you must also sacrifice a one year old lamb to take away your guilt.


## Numbers 6:13 (id: 1004006013)

13When the time that you promised to dedicate yourself to me is ended, go to the entrance of the sacred tent


## Numbers 6:14 (id: 1004006014)

14and offer as sacrifices to me three animals that have no defects. Offer a one year old ram that will be burned completely, a one year old female lamb as a sacrifice to take away the guilt of your sin, and one full\-grown ram as a sacrifice to restore fellowship with me.


## Numbers 6:15 (id: 1004006015)

15When you bring those animals, you must also bring some wine to offer as a sacrifice. And you must also bring a basket of bread that you have made with very good flour and olive oil. But you must not put any yeast in the bread. Also brush some olive oil on some thin wafers and bring them to the priest.


## Numbers 6:16 (id: 1004006016)

16The priest will put the young lamb and the young ram on the altar and completely burn them, in order that I will be pleased and will forgive you.


## Numbers 6:17 (id: 1004006017)

17Then he will kill the full\-grown ram as an offering to restore fellowship with me, and he will also burn on the altar some of the bread and the flour and wine.


## Numbers 6:18 (id: 1004006018)

18After that, you must stand at the entrance of the sacred tent and shave off your hair. Then you must put that hair in the fire that is under the animal that has been sacrificed on the altar to restore fellowship with me.


## Numbers 6:19 (id: 1004006019)

19The meat from the ram’s shoulder must be boiled. After it is cooked, the priest will take it along with one of the loaves of bread and one wafer which has been brushed with olive oil, and he will put them in your hands.


## Numbers 6:20 (id: 1004006020)

20Then the priest will take them back and lift them up high to dedicate them to me. They now belong to the priest, and he is permitted to eat some of the meat from the ram’s shoulder and from its ribs and from one of its thighs, because that meat is his share of the sacrifice. After that, you will no longer be a Nazir, and you will again be permitted to drink wine.


## Numbers 6:21 (id: 1004006021)

21Those are the regulations about the offerings that Nazir solemnly promise to bring to me to end their time of being dedicated to me. They must bring these offerings, but if they want to, they may bring additional offerings. And they must do everything that they solemnly promised to do when they dedicated themselves to me.”


## Numbers 6:22 (id: 1004006022)

22Yahweh also said to Moses,


## Numbers 6:23 (id: 1004006023)

23“Tell Aaron and his sons that when they ask me to bless the people, they must say,


## Numbers 6:24 (id: 1004006024)

24‘Yahweh bless you and protect you.


## Numbers 6:25 (id: 1004006025)

25May he smile on you and act kindly toward you.


## Numbers 6:26 (id: 1004006026)

26May he be good to you and cause things to go well for you.’”


## Numbers 6:27 (id: 1004006027)

27Then Yahweh said, “If Aaron and his sons ask me to bless the Israelite people, truly I will bless them.”


## Numbers 7:1 (id: 1004007001)

1When Moses had finished setting up the sacred tent, he poured oil on it, and set it apart for the honor of Yahweh. He also dedicated the things that are inside the sacred tent, and the altar for burning sacrifices, and all the things that would be used at the altar.


## Numbers 7:2 (id: 1004007002)

2Then the leaders of the twelve Israelite tribes, the same men who had helped Aaron and Moses to count the men who could fight in battles,


## Numbers 7:3 (id: 1004007003)

3came to the sacred tent, bringing gifts to Yahweh. They brought six sturdy carts and twelve oxen, one ox from each of the leaders and a cart from each of the two leaders.


## Numbers 7:4 (id: 1004007004)

4Then Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 7:5 (id: 1004007005)

5“Accept these gifts, in order that the descendants of Levi can use them for carrying the sacred items that are here at the sacred tent.”


## Numbers 7:6 (id: 1004007006)

6So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the descendants of Levi.


## Numbers 7:7 (id: 1004007007)

7He gave two carts and four oxen to the descendants of Gershon for their work,


## Numbers 7:8 (id: 1004007008)

8and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the descendants of Merari for their work. Aaron’s son Ithamar was the supervisor of all their work.


## Numbers 7:9 (id: 1004007009)

9But he did not give any carts or oxen to the descendants of Kohath, because they took care of the sacred items that were to be carried on their shoulders, not on carts.


## Numbers 7:10 (id: 1004007010)

10On the day that the altar was dedicated, the twelve leaders brought other gifts to be dedicated and put them in front of the altar.


## Numbers 7:11 (id: 1004007011)

11Yahweh said to Moses, “On each of the next twelve days one leader should bring his gifts for the dedication of the altar.”


## Numbers 7:12 (id: 1004007012)

12On the first day, Nahshon son of Amminadab, from the tribe of Judah brought his gifts:


## Numbers 7:13 (id: 1004007013)

13a silver dish that weighed one and one\-half kilograms and a silver bowl that weighed four\-fifths of a kilogram. Both of these were full of good flour and mixed with olive oil to be flour offerings. They were both weighed using the standard scales.


## Numbers 7:14 (id: 1004007014)

14He also brought a small gold dish that weighed 14 grams and was filled with incense,


## Numbers 7:15 (id: 1004007015)

15a young bull, a ram, and a one\-year\-old male lamb, to be sacrificed completely by being burned on the altar,


## Numbers 7:16 (id: 1004007016)

16a goat to be sacrificed to remove people’s guilt for their sins,


## Numbers 7:17 (id: 1004007017)

17as well as two cattle, five male sheep, five male goats, and five one\-year\-old male lambs to be sacrificed for maintaining fellowship {with Yahweh}. All these are what Nahshon son of Amminadab gave.


## Numbers 7:18 (id: 1004007018)

## Numbers 7:89 (id: 1004007089)

89Whenever Moses entered the sacred tent to talk with Yahweh, he heard Yahweh’s voice speaking between the two images of creatures with wings that were above the lid of the sacred chest.


## Numbers 8:1 (id: 1004008001)

1Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 8:2 (id: 1004008002)

2“Tell Aaron to put the seven lamps on the lampstand and place them in such a way that they shine toward the front of the lampstand.”


## Numbers 8:3 (id: 1004008003)

3So Moses told him what Yahweh said, and he did that.


## Numbers 8:4 (id: 1004008004)

4The lampstand had been made from gold that had been hammered from one large lump of gold, from its base to the decorations at the top that resembled flowers. The lampstand was made exactly as Yahweh had told Moses that it should be made.


## Numbers 8:5 (id: 1004008005)

5Yahweh also said to Moses,


## Numbers 8:6 (id: 1004008006)

6“You must cause the descendants of Levi to be acceptable to me by setting them apart from the other Israelite people.


## Numbers 8:7 (id: 1004008007)

7Do that by sprinkling them with water which will symbolize their being freed from the guilt of their sins. Then they must shave off all the hair of their bodies and wash their clothes.


## Numbers 8:8 (id: 1004008008)

8Then they must bring one bull and some flour mixed with olive oil. Those things will be burned as sacrifices. They must also bring another bull that will be sacrificed to take away the guilt of their sins.


## Numbers 8:9 (id: 1004008009)

9Then you must summon all the Israelite people to come together in front of the sacred tent, to gather around the descendants of Levi.


## Numbers 8:10 (id: 1004008010)

10Then the Israelite people must lay their hands on the descendants of Levi.


## Numbers 8:11 (id: 1004008011)

11Aaron must then present them to me to be a gift from the Israelite people, as if he had lifted them up to me, in order that they can work for me at the sacred tent.


## Numbers 8:12 (id: 1004008012)

12After that, the descendants of Levi must place their hands on the heads of the two bulls. Then the bulls will be killed and burned on the altar. One will be an offering to take away the guilt of their sins, and the other will be completely burned to please me.


## Numbers 8:13 (id: 1004008013)

13The descendants of Levi must stand at the altar in front of Aaron and his sons, and you must then dedicate them to me, as if you had lifted them up to me.


## Numbers 8:14 (id: 1004008014)

14This ritual will show that the descendants of Levi are set apart from the other Israelites and that they belong to me.


## Numbers 8:15 (id: 1004008015)

15After the descendants of Levi have been made acceptable to me, and presented to me like a special offering as if they had been lifted up to me, they may start to work at the sacred tent.


## Numbers 8:16 (id: 1004008016)

16They will belong to me. They will work for me as substitutes for the firstborn males of all the Israelites, who also belong to me.


## Numbers 8:17 (id: 1004008017)

17All the firstborn males in Israel, both the people and the animals, are mine. When I caused all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt to die, I set them apart for myself. But I spared the firstborn of all males of the Israelites, of people and animals, because they are mine.


## Numbers 8:18 (id: 1004008018)

18But now I have chosen the descendants of Levi to take the places of the firsborn male sons of the other Israelites.


## Numbers 8:19 (id: 1004008019)

19I have appointed the descendants of Levi to help Aaron and his sons at the sacred tent, as Aaron and his sons offer the sacrifices to take away the guilt of the Israelite people’s sins, and to prevent the Israelites from coming close to the tent with the result that a plague would cause many of them to become sick and die.”


## Numbers 8:20 (id: 1004008020)

20Aaron and Moses and the other Israelites helped the descendants of Levi to do everything that Yahweh had commanded.


## Numbers 8:21 (id: 1004008021)

21The descendants of Levi sprinkled themselves with water to symbolize that they had been freed from the guilt of their sins, and they washed their clothes. Then Aaron brought them to the altar to present them to Yahweh, just as if he had lifted them up to him, and he offered sacrifices to take away the guilt of their sins and cause them to become acceptable to Yahweh.


## Numbers 8:22 (id: 1004008022)

22After that, the descendants of Levi started to work at the sacred tent to assist Aaron and his sons. They did that just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.


## Numbers 8:23 (id: 1004008023)

23Yahweh also said this to Moses:


## Numbers 8:24 (id: 1004008024)

24“The descendants of Levi who are between twenty\-five years and fifty years old will work at the sacred tent.


## Numbers 8:25 (id: 1004008025)

25But after they become fifty years old, they must retire.


## Numbers 8:26 (id: 1004008026)

26They may help their fellow descendants of Levi do their work at the sacred tent, but they must not do the work themselves. That is what you must tell them about the work they will do.”


## Numbers 9:1 (id: 1004009001)

1One year after the Israelites left Egypt, on the first month of the second year, while they were in the wilderness of Sinai, Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 9:2 (id: 1004009002)

2“Tell the Israelite people that they must celebrate the Passover festival again.


## Numbers 9:3 (id: 1004009003)

3They must do it on the fourteenth day of this month, early in the evening, and they must obey all the instructions about it that I gave you previously.”


## Numbers 9:4 (id: 1004009004)

4So Moses told the people what Yahweh had said about celebrating the Passover.


## Numbers 9:5 (id: 1004009005)

5The people celebrated it there in the wilderness of Sinai, in the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.


## Numbers 9:6 (id: 1004009006)

6But some of the Israelite people had touched a corpse, and as a result they had become unfit to celebrate the Passover. So they asked Aaron and Moses,


## Numbers 9:7 (id: 1004009007)

7“It is true that we have touched a corpse. But why should that prevent us from celebrating the Passover festival and offering sacrifices to Yahweh like everyone else?”


## Numbers 9:8 (id: 1004009008)

8Moses replied, “Wait here until I go into the sacred tent and find out what Yahweh says about it.”


## Numbers 9:9 (id: 1004009009)

9So Moses went into the tent and asked Yahweh what he should tell the people, and this is what Yahweh said:


## Numbers 9:10 (id: 1004009010)

10“Tell this to the Israelite people: ‘If any of you or your descendants touch a corpse and as a result become unacceptable to me, or if you are away from home on a long trip at the time to celebrate the Passover, you will still be permitted to celebrate it.


## Numbers 9:11 (id: 1004009011)

11But you must celebrate it exactly one month later, early in the evening of the fourteenth day of that month. Eat the meat of the lamb for the Passover festival with bread that is baked without yeast, and eat bitter herbs.


## Numbers 9:12 (id: 1004009012)

12Do not leave any of it until the next morning. And do not break any of the lamb’s bones. Obey all the regulations about celebrating the Passover.


## Numbers 9:13 (id: 1004009013)

13But if any of you has not done anything that would make you unfit to celebrate the Passover festival, and you are not away from home on a long trip, and you do not sacrifice to me at the proper time, you will no longer belong to my people. You will be punished.


## Numbers 9:14 (id: 1004009014)

14Settled foreigners who live among you must also celebrate the Passover festival and obey all my commands concerning it.’”


## Numbers 9:15 (id: 1004009015)

15On the day that the sacred tent where the Ten Commandments were was set up, a cloud covered it. But from the time that the sun set until the time that the sun rose the next day, the cloud resembled a huge fire.


## Numbers 9:16 (id: 1004009016)

16And that is what happened every day that the Israelites were in the wilderness. The cloud would cover it during the day and resemble a huge for during the night.


## Numbers 9:17 (id: 1004009017)

17When the cloud rose up and started to move to a new location, the Israelites followed it. When the cloud stopped, the Israelites stopped there and set up their tents.


## Numbers 9:18 (id: 1004009018)

18The Israelites moved when Yahweh told them to move and stopped when Yahweh told them to stop by causing the cloud to move or stop. When the cloud stayed over the sacred tent, the Israelites stayed at that place.


## Numbers 9:19 (id: 1004009019)

19Sometimes the cloud stayed over the sacred tent for a long time, so when that happened, the Israelites did not move.


## Numbers 9:20 (id: 1004009020)

20Sometimes the cloud remained over the sacred tent for only a few days. The people stopped and set up their tents as Yahweh commanded them, and they moved to a new location when Yahweh commanded them to do that.


## Numbers 9:21 (id: 1004009021)

21Sometimes the cloud stayed in one place for only one day. When that happened, when the cloud rose up into the sky the next morning, then the people moved. Whenever the cloud moved, during the day or during the night, the people moved.


## Numbers 9:22 (id: 1004009022)

22If the cloud stayed over the sacred tent for two days, or for a month, or for a year, during that time the people stayed where they were. But when the cloud rose up into the sky, they started to move.


## Numbers 9:23 (id: 1004009023)

23When Yahweh commanded them to stop and set up their tents, they did that. When he told them to move, they moved. They did whatever Yahweh told Moses they should do.


## Numbers 10:1 (id: 1004010001)

1Yahweh also told Moses,


## Numbers 10:2 (id: 1004010002)

2“Tell someone to make two trumpets by hammering each one from one lump of silver. Blow the trumpets to summon the people to come together and also to signal that they must move their tents to a new location.


## Numbers 10:3 (id: 1004010003)

3If both trumpets are blown, it means that everyone must gather together at the entrance of the sacred tent.


## Numbers 10:4 (id: 1004010004)

4If only one trumpet is blown, it means that only the twelve leaders of the tribes must gather together.


## Numbers 10:5 (id: 1004010005)

5If the trumpets are blown loudly, the tribes that are to the east of the sacred tent should start to move.


## Numbers 10:6 (id: 1004010006)

6When the trumpets are blown loudly the second time, the tribes that are to the south should start to move. The loud blasts on the trumpet will signal that they should start to move.


## Numbers 10:7 (id: 1004010007)

7When you want only to gather the people together, blow the trumpets, but do not blow them as loudly.


## Numbers 10:8 (id: 1004010008)

8The priests who are descended from Aaron are the ones who should blow the trumpets. That is a regulation that will never be changed.


## Numbers 10:9 (id: 1004010009)

9When you fight against enemies who attack you in your own land, tell the priests to blow the trumpets loudly. I, Yahweh, your God, will hear that, and I will rescue you from your enemies.


## Numbers 10:10 (id: 1004010010)

10Also tell the priests to blow the trumpets when the people are happy, and at the festivals each year, and at the times when they celebrate the new moon each month. Tell them to blow the trumpets when the people bring offerings that will be completely burned, and when they bring offerings to restore fellowship with me. If they do that, it will help you to think about me. You must do that, because I am Yahweh your God.”


## Numbers 10:11 (id: 1004010011)

11In the second year after the Israelites left Egypt, on the twentieth day of the second month, the cloud rose up from above the sacred tent where the Ten Commandments were.


## Numbers 10:12 (id: 1004010012)

12So the Israelites moved from the wilderness of Sinai, and they continued traveling north until the cloud stopped in the wilderness of Paran.


## Numbers 10:13 (id: 1004010013)

13That was the first time they moved, obeying the instructions that Yahweh had given to Moses to tell them.


## Numbers 10:14 (id: 1004010014)

14The group that went first, carrying their flag, was the group from the tribe of Judah. Nahshon son of Amminadab, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:15 (id: 1004010015)

15The group from the tribe of Issachar followed them. Nethanel son of Zuar, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:16 (id: 1004010016)

16The group from the tribe of Zebulun went next. Eliab son of Helon, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:17 (id: 1004010017)

17Then they dismantled the sacred tent, and the descendants of Gershon and Merari carried it, and they went next.


## Numbers 10:18 (id: 1004010018)

18The group from the tribe of Reuben went next, carrying their flag. Elizur son of Shedeur was their leader.


## Numbers 10:19 (id: 1004010019)

19The group from the tribe of Simeon was next. Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was their leader.


## Numbers 10:20 (id: 1004010020)

20The group from the tribe of Gad was next. Eliasaph son of Deuel was their leader.


## Numbers 10:21 (id: 1004010021)

21The group descended from Kohath was next. They carried the sacred items from the sacred tent. The sacred tent was set up at the new location before they arrived there.


## Numbers 10:22 (id: 1004010022)

22The group from the tribe of Ephraim was next, carrying their flag. Elishama son of Ammihud, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:23 (id: 1004010023)

23The group from the tribe of Manasseh went next. Gamaliel son of Pedahzur, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:24 (id: 1004010024)

24The group from the tribe of Benjamin was next. Abidan son of Gideoni, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:25 (id: 1004010025)

25The ones who went last were the groups from the tribe of Dan, carrying their flag. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:26 (id: 1004010026)

26The group from the tribe of Asher went next. Pagiel son of Ocran, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:27 (id: 1004010027)

27The group from the tribe of Naphtali went last. Ahira son of Enan, was their leader.


## Numbers 10:28 (id: 1004010028)

28That was the order in which the groups of Israelite tribes traveled.


## Numbers 10:29 (id: 1004010029)

29One day Moses said to his brother\-in\-law Hobab son of Reuel from the Midian people group, “We are on the way to the place that Yahweh promised to give to us. Come with us, and we will take good care of you, because Yahweh has promised to do good things for us Israelite people.”


## Numbers 10:30 (id: 1004010030)

30But Hobab replied, “No, I will not go with you. I want to return to my own land and to my own family.”


## Numbers 10:31 (id: 1004010031)

31But Moses said, “Please do not leave us. You know the places where we can set up our tents in this desert, and you can guide us.


## Numbers 10:32 (id: 1004010032)

32Come with us. We will share with you all the good things that Yahweh gives to us.”


## Numbers 10:33 (id: 1004010033)

33So Hobab agreed to go with them. The Israelites left Mount Sinai, which they called the Mountain of Yahweh, and they walked for three days. The men carrying the sacred chest went in front of the other people for those three days, and they kept looking for a place to set up their tents.


## Numbers 10:34 (id: 1004010034)

34The cloud sent by Yahweh was over them every day.


## Numbers 10:35 (id: 1004010035)

35Each morning when the men who were carrying the sacred chest started to walk, Moses said, “Yahweh, arise! Scatter your enemies! Cause those who hate you to run away from you!”


## Numbers 10:36 (id: 1004010036)

36And each time the men stopped to set down the sacred chest, Moses said, “Yahweh, stay close to the multiplied thousands of us Israelites!”


## Numbers 11:1 (id: 1004011001)

1One day the people complained to Yahweh about their troubles. When Yahweh heard what they were saying, he became angry. So he sent a fire which burned among the people at the edge of their camp.


## Numbers 11:2 (id: 1004011002)

2Then the people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to Yahweh. Then the fire stopped burning.


## Numbers 11:3 (id: 1004011003)

3So they called that place Taberah, which means ‘Burning,’ because the fire from Yahweh had burned among them.


## Numbers 11:4 (id: 1004011004)

4Then some troublemakers from other people groups who were traveling with the Israelites began to want better food. And when they started complaining the Israelite people also started to complain. They said, “We wish we had some meat to eat!


## Numbers 11:5 (id: 1004011005)

5We remember the fish that we ate while we were in Egypt, fish that was given to us without cost. And we had all the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic we could eat.


## Numbers 11:6 (id: 1004011006)

6But now we have lost our appetite, because all we have to eat is this manna!”


## Numbers 11:7 (id: 1004011007)

7The manna resembled small white seeds.


## Numbers 11:8 (id: 1004011008)

8Each morning the people would go out and gather some from the surface of the ground. Then they made flour by grinding it or pounding it with stones. Then they added water and boiled it in a pot, or they made flat cakes with it and baked them. The cakes tasted like bread that was baked with olive oil.


## Numbers 11:9 (id: 1004011009)

9Each night the manna came down on the ground where their tents were, like dew from the sky.


## Numbers 11:10 (id: 1004011010)

10Moses heard all the Israelite people complaining as they were standing in the entrances of their tents. Yahweh became very angry, and Moses was also very perturbed.


## Numbers 11:11 (id: 1004011011)

11He went into the sacred tent and asked Yahweh, “Why have you brought this trouble on me, your servant? Act mercifully to me! What wrong have I done, with the result that you have appointed me to take care of all of these people?


## Numbers 11:12 (id: 1004011012)

12I am not their father. Why have you told me to take care of them like a woman carries around her baby and nurses it? How can I take them to the land that you promised to give to our ancestors?


## Numbers 11:13 (id: 1004011013)

13Where can I get meat to feed to all these people? They keep complaining to me, saying, ‘Give us some meat to eat!’


## Numbers 11:14 (id: 1004011014)

14I cannot carry all these people’s burdens by myself! They are like a heavy load to me, and I cannot carry this very heavy load anymore.


## Numbers 11:15 (id: 1004011015)

15If you intend to act like this toward me, kill me now. If you are really concerned about me, be kind to me and kill me to end my misery of trying to take care of them!”


## Numbers 11:16 (id: 1004011016)

16Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Summon seventy men whom you know are leaders among the Israelite people. Tell them to stand with you in front of the sacred tent.


## Numbers 11:17 (id: 1004011017)

17I will come down and talk with you there. Then I will take some of the power of my Spirit that you have, and I will put that power on them also. They will help you to take care of some of the things that the people are concerned about, in order that you will not need to do it alone.


## Numbers 11:18 (id: 1004011018)

18Furthermore, say to the people, ‘Make yourselves acceptable to me, and tomorrow you will have meat to eat. You were complaining, and Yahweh heard you when you were saying, “We want some meat to eat. We had better food in Egypt!” Now Yahweh will give you some meat, and you will eat it.


## Numbers 11:19 (id: 1004011019)

19You will eat meat not only for one or two days, or only for five or ten or twenty days.


## Numbers 11:20 (id: 1004011020)

20You will eat meat every day for one month, and then you will loathe it, and it will cause you to want to vomit. This will happen because you have rejected Yahweh who is here among you, and you have wailed in his presence, saying “We would have had better food to eat if we had not left Egypt.”’”


## Numbers 11:21 (id: 1004011021)

21But Moses replied to Yahweh, “There are six hundred thousand men plus women and children here with me, so why do you say ‘I will give them plenty of meat every day for a month!’?


## Numbers 11:22 (id: 1004011022)

22Even if we killed all the sheep and cattle, that would not be enough to provide meat for all of them! Even if we caught all the fish in the sea and gave it to them, that would not be enough!”


## Numbers 11:23 (id: 1004011023)

23But Yahweh said to Moses, “Do you think that I have no power? You will now see if I can do what I say I will do.”


## Numbers 11:24 (id: 1004011024)

24So Moses went out from the sacred tent and told the people what Yahweh had said. Then he gathered together the seventy leaders and told them to stand around the sacred tent.


## Numbers 11:25 (id: 1004011025)

25Then Yahweh came down in the cloud that was above the tent and spoke to Moses. He took some of the power of the Spirit that he had given to Moses and gave it to the seventy leaders. By means of the power of the Spirit within them, they prophesied, but they did that only once.


## Numbers 11:26 (id: 1004011026)

26Two of the leaders whom Moses appointed, Eldad and Medad, were not there when the rest of them gathered together. They had not left their tents to go and stand around the sacred tent. But Yahweh’s Spirit came on them also, and they started to prophesy.


## Numbers 11:27 (id: 1004011027)

27So a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying where all their tents are!”


## Numbers 11:28 (id: 1004011028)

28Joshua, who had helped Moses since he was a young man, said, “Sir, tell them to stop doing that!”


## Numbers 11:29 (id: 1004011029)

29But Moses replied, “Are you worried that they might injure my reputation? I wish that all Yahweh’s people could prophesy. I wish that Yahweh would give the power of his Spirit to all of them!”


## Numbers 11:30 (id: 1004011030)

30Then Moses and all the leaders went back to their tents.


## Numbers 11:31 (id: 1004011031)

31Then Yahweh sent a strong wind from the sea. It blew quail into the area all around the camp, and caused the quail to fall onto the ground. They were piled up on the ground a meter high!


## Numbers 11:32 (id: 1004011032)

32So the people went out and gathered up the quail all that day, and all that night, and all of the following day. It seemed as though each person gathered two cubic meters! They spread the quail out on the ground all around the camp, so that the quail would lose their moisture.


## Numbers 11:33 (id: 1004011033)

33Then they cooked them and started to eat them. But while they were still eating the meat, Yahweh showed that he was very angry with them. He sent a severe plague on them, and many people died.


## Numbers 11:34 (id: 1004011034)

34The people who died and were buried were the ones who had said they wanted to eat meat like they had formerly eaten in Egypt. So they called that place Kibroth Hattaavah, which means ‘graves of those who craved.’


## Numbers 11:35 (id: 1004011035)

35From there, the Israelites continued walking east until they arrived at Hazeroth, where they stopped and stayed for a long time.


## Numbers 12:1 (id: 1004012001)

1Moses’ older sister Miriam and his older brother Aaron {were jealous of Moses and} criticized Moses because he had married a woman who was a descendant of the Cush people group.


## Numbers 12:2 (id: 1004012002)

2They said, “Is Moses the only one to whom Yahweh has spoken messages to tell to us? Does Yahweh not speak messages through us two also?” Yahweh heard what Miriam and Aaron said about Moses.


## Numbers 12:3 (id: 1004012003)

3The truth was that Moses was a very humble person. He was more humble than anyone else on the earth.


## Numbers 12:4 (id: 1004012004)

4So immediately Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam. He said, “All three of you must go and stand at the sacred tent.” So they did that.


## Numbers 12:5 (id: 1004012005)

5Then Yahweh descended to the entrance of the tent in a cloud that resembled a huge white pillar. He told Aaron and Miriam to step forward, so they did.


## Numbers 12:6 (id: 1004012006)

6Then he said to them, “Listen to me! When a prophet is among you, I usually reveal myself to him by allowing him to see visions, and I speak to him in dreams.


## Numbers 12:7 (id: 1004012007)

7But that is not the way I speak to my servant Moses. I trust that he will lead my people well.


## Numbers 12:8 (id: 1004012008)

8So I talk to him face to face. I speak to him clearly, not using parables. He has even seen what I look like. So you should be afraid to criticize my servant Moses!”


## Numbers 12:9 (id: 1004012009)

9Yahweh was very angry with Miriam and Aaron, and he left.


## Numbers 12:10 (id: 1004012010)

10When the cloud rose up from the sacred tent, Aaron looked at Miriam, and he saw that her skin was as white as snow, because she now had leprosy.


## Numbers 12:11 (id: 1004012011)

11Aaron said to Moses, “My master, please do not punish us for this sin that we have foolishly committed.


## Numbers 12:12 (id: 1004012012)

12Do not allow Miriam to be like a baby that is already dead when it is born, whose flesh is already half decayed!”


## Numbers 12:13 (id: 1004012013)

13So Moses cried out to Yahweh, saying, “God, I plead with you to heal her!”


## Numbers 12:14 (id: 1004012014)

14But Yahweh replied, “If her father had rebuked her for doing something wrong by spitting in her face, she would have been ashamed for seven days. She should be ashamed because of what she has done. So send her outside the camp for seven days. Then she will not have leprosy anymore, and she may return to the camp.”


## Numbers 12:15 (id: 1004012015)

15So they sent her outside the camp for seven days. The people did not move to another location until she returned.


## Numbers 12:16 (id: 1004012016)

16But after she returned, they left Hazeroth and moved north in the Paran Desert and set up their tents there.


## Numbers 13:1 (id: 1004013001)

1Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 13:2 (id: 1004013002)

2“Send some men to Canaan to explore it. That is the land that I will give to you Israelites. Send men who are leaders in their tribes.”


## Numbers 13:3 (id: 1004013003)

3So Moses did what Yahweh commanded him. He sent out twelve Israelite men who were all leaders of their tribes. He sent them from their camp at Paran in the desert.


## Numbers 13:4 (id: 1004013004)

4These are the names of the men and the tribes they belonged to: Shammua son of Zaccur, from the tribe of Reuben;


## Numbers 13:5 (id: 1004013005)

5Shaphat son of Hori, from the tribe of Simeon;


## Numbers 13:6 (id: 1004013006)

6Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;


## Numbers 13:7 (id: 1004013007)

7Igal son of Joseph, from the tribe of Issachar;


## Numbers 13:8 (id: 1004013008)

8Hoshea the son of Nun, from the tribe of Ephraim;


## Numbers 13:9 (id: 1004013009)

9Palti son of Raphu, from the tribe of Benjamin;


## Numbers 13:10 (id: 1004013010)

10Gaddiel son of Sodi, from the tribe of Zebulun;


## Numbers 13:11 (id: 1004013011)

11Gaddi son of Susi, from the tribe of Joseph’s descendent Manasseh;


## Numbers 13:12 (id: 1004013012)

12Ammiel the son of Gemalli, from the tribe of Dan;


## Numbers 13:13 (id: 1004013013)

13Sethur son of Michael, from the tribe of Asher;


## Numbers 13:14 (id: 1004013014)

14Nahbi son of Vophsi, from the tribe of Naphtali;


## Numbers 13:15 (id: 1004013015)

15and Geuel son of Maki, from the tribe of Gad.


## Numbers 13:16 (id: 1004013016)

16Those are the names of the men whom Moses sent out to explore Canaan. Before they left, Moses gave Hoshea a new name, Joshua, which means ‘Yahweh is the one who saves.’


## Numbers 13:17 (id: 1004013017)

17Before Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said to them, “Go through the southern Judean wilderness, and then go north into the hill country.


## Numbers 13:18 (id: 1004013018)

18See what the land is like. See if the people who live there are strong or weak. See if there are many people or only a few people.


## Numbers 13:19 (id: 1004013019)

19Find out what kind of land they live in. Is it good or bad? Find out about the towns in which they live. Do they have walls around them or not?


## Numbers 13:20 (id: 1004013020)

20Find out about the soil. Is it fertile or not? Find out if there are trees there. Try to bring back some of the fruit that grows in that land.” He said that because it was the beginning of the time to harvest grapes.


## Numbers 13:21 (id: 1004013021)

21So those men went to Canaan. They went through the entire land, from the wilderness of Zin in the south all the way to the city of Rehob near Lebo Hamath in the north.


## Numbers 13:22 (id: 1004013022)

22In the southern Judean wilderness, they went to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, huge men descended from Anak, lived. Hebron was a city that was built seven years before the city of Zoan was built in Egypt.


## Numbers 13:23 (id: 1004013023)

23In one valley, they cut from a grapevine one cluster of grapes. Because it was very large, they needed two men to carry it on a pole. They also picked some pomegranates and some figs to carry back to their camp.


## Numbers 13:24 (id: 1004013024)

24They called that place Eshcol which means ‘cluster’ because they had cut that huge cluster of grapes there.


## Numbers 13:25 (id: 1004013025)

25After they explored the land for forty days, they returned to their camp.


## Numbers 13:26 (id: 1004013026)

26They came to Aaron and Moses and the rest of the Israelite people in the wilderness at Paran. They reported to everyone what they had seen. They also showed them the fruit that they had brought back.


## Numbers 13:27 (id: 1004013027)

27But this is what they reported to Moses: “We arrived in the land that you sent us to explore. It is truly a beautiful land. It is a very fertile land. Here is some of the fruit.


## Numbers 13:28 (id: 1004013028)

28But the people who live there are very strong. Their cities are large and are surrounded by walls. We even saw some of the huge descendants of Anak there.


## Numbers 13:29 (id: 1004013029)

29The descendants of Amalek live in the southern part of the land, and the descendants of Heth, Jebus, and Amor live in the hill country to the north. The descendants of Canaan live along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and along the Jordan River.”


## Numbers 13:30 (id: 1004013030)

30Caleb told the people who were standing near Moses to be quiet. Then he said, “We should go there and take the land, because we are certainly able to conquer it!”


## Numbers 13:31 (id: 1004013031)

31But the men who had gone with him said, “No, we cannot attack and defeat those people. They are much stronger than we are!”


## Numbers 13:32 (id: 1004013032)

32So those men gave to the Israelite people a bad report about the land that they had explored. They said, “The land that we explored destroys the life those who try to attack it. And all the people living there are very tall.


## Numbers 13:33 (id: 1004013033)

33We also saw giants there. They are the descendants of Anak (who come from the Nephilim, those giant people). When we saw these giants we felt as small as grasshoppers and they thought that we looked like grasshoppers too.”


## Numbers 14:1 (id: 1004014001)

1That night, all the Israelite people cried loudly.


## Numbers 14:2 (id: 1004014002)

2The next day they all complained against Aaron and Moses. All the men said, “We wish that we had died in Egypt, or in this wilderness!


## Numbers 14:3 (id: 1004014003)

3Why is Yahweh bringing us to this land, where we men will be killed with swords? And they will take away our wives and children to be their slaves. Instead of going to Canaan, it would be better for us to return to Egypt!”


## Numbers 14:4 (id: 1004014004)

4Then some of them said to each other, “We should choose a leader who will take us back to Egypt!”


## Numbers 14:5 (id: 1004014005)

5Then Aaron and Moses bowed down to pray in front of all the Israelite people who had gathered there.


## Numbers 14:6 (id: 1004014006)

6Joshua and Caleb, two of the men who had explored the land, tore their clothes because they were very dismayed.


## Numbers 14:7 (id: 1004014007)

7They said to the Israelite people, “The land that we explored is very good.


## Numbers 14:8 (id: 1004014008)

8If Yahweh is pleased with us, he will lead us into that very fertile land, and he will give it to us.


## Numbers 14:9 (id: 1004014009)

9So do not rebel against Yahweh! And do not be afraid of the people in that land! We will gobble them up! They do not have anyone who will protect them, but Yahweh will be with us and help us. So do not be afraid of them!”


## Numbers 14:10 (id: 1004014010)

10Then all the Israelite people talked about killing Caleb and Joshua by throwing stones at them. But suddenly Yahweh’s glory appeared to them at the sacred tent.


## Numbers 14:11 (id: 1004014011)

11Then Yahweh said to Moses, “How long will these people reject me? I am tired of them not believing in what I can do, in spite of all the miracles I have performed among them.


## Numbers 14:12 (id: 1004014012)

12So I will send a plague among them and get rid of them. But I will cause your descendants to become a great nation. They will be a nation that is much greater and stronger than these people are.”


## Numbers 14:13 (id: 1004014013)

13But Moses replied to Yahweh, “Please do not do that, because the people of Egypt will hear about it! You brought these Israelite people from Egypt by your great power,


## Numbers 14:14 (id: 1004014014)

14and the people of Egypt will tell that to the descendants of Canaan who live in this land. Yahweh, they have already heard about you. They know that you have been with these people and that they have seen you face to face. They have heard that your cloud is like a huge pillar that stays over them, and by that cloud you lead them during the day, and that the cloud becomes like a fire at night to give them light.


## Numbers 14:15 (id: 1004014015)

15If you kill these people all at one time, the people groups who have heard about your power will say,


## Numbers 14:16 (id: 1004014016)

16‘Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land that he promised to give to them, so he killed them in the wilderness.’


## Numbers 14:17 (id: 1004014017)

17So Yahweh, now show that you are very powerful. You said,


## Numbers 14:18 (id: 1004014018)

18‘I do not quickly become angry. Instead, I love people greatly, and I forgive people for having sinned and having disobeyed my laws. But I will always punish people who are guilty of doing what is wrong. When parents sin, I will punish them, but I will also punish their children and their grandchildren and their great\-grandchildren and their great\-great\-grandchildren.’


## Numbers 14:19 (id: 1004014019)

19So, because you love your people with a great covenant loyalty, forgive these people for the sins that they have committed, just like you have continued to forgive them ever since they left Egypt.”


## Numbers 14:20 (id: 1004014020)

20Then Yahweh replied, “I have forgiven them, as you requested me to.


## Numbers 14:21 (id: 1004014021)

21But, just as certainly as I live and that people all over the world can see my glory, I solemnly declare that


## Numbers 14:22 (id: 1004014022)

22all these people saw my glory and all the miracles that I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, but they disobeyed me, and many times they tested whether they could continue to do evil things without my punishing them.


## Numbers 14:23 (id: 1004014023)

23Because of that, not one of them will see the land that I promised their ancestors that I would give to them. No one who rejected me will see that land.


## Numbers 14:24 (id: 1004014024)

24But Caleb, who serves me well, is different from the others. He obeys me completely. So I will bring him into that land that he has already seen, and his descendants will inherit some of it.


## Numbers 14:25 (id: 1004014025)

25So, since the descendants of Amalek and Canaan who are living in the valleys in Canaan are very strong, when you leave here tomorrow, instead of traveling toward Canaan, go back along the road through the wilderness toward the Sea of Reeds.”


## Numbers 14:26 (id: 1004014026)

26Then Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses,


## Numbers 14:27 (id: 1004014027)

27“How long will the wicked people of this nation keep complaining about me? I have heard everything that they have grumbled against me.


## Numbers 14:28 (id: 1004014028)

28So now tell them this: ‘Just as certainly as I, Yahweh, live, I will do exactly what you said would happen.


## Numbers 14:29 (id: 1004014029)

29I will cause all of you to die here in this wilderness! Because you grumbled against me, none of you who are more than twenty years old and who were counted when Moses counted everyone


## Numbers 14:30 (id: 1004014030)

30will enter the land that I solemnly promised to give to you. Only Caleb and Joshua will enter that land.


## Numbers 14:31 (id: 1004014031)

31You said that your children would be taken from you to become slaves, but I will take them into the land, and they will enjoy living in the land that you rejected.


## Numbers 14:32 (id: 1004014032)

32But as for you adults, you will die here in this wilderness.


## Numbers 14:33 (id: 1004014033)

33Your children will wander around in this wilderness as shepherds for forty years. Because you adults were not loyal to me, your children will suffer until you all die in the wilderness.


## Numbers 14:34 (id: 1004014034)

34You will suffer for your sins for forty years. That will be one year for each of the forty days that the twelve men explored Canaan land. And I will be like an enemy to you.


## Numbers 14:35 (id: 1004014035)

35This will certainly happen because I, Yahweh, have said it! I will do these things to every one in this group that has plotted against me. They will all die right here in this wilderness!’”


## Numbers 14:36 (id: 1004014036)

36(36\-37\) Then Yahweh attacked the ten men who had discouraged the people, so that they died. These were the men who had explored Canaan and then told the people that they would not be able to take over the land. It was because of the men that the people spoke against Moses.


## Numbers 14:38 (id: 1004014038)

38Of the twelve men who had explored Canaan, only Joshua and Caleb remained alive.


## Numbers 14:39 (id: 1004014039)

39When Moses reported to the Israelite people what Yahweh had said, many of them were very sad.


## Numbers 14:40 (id: 1004014040)

40So the people got up early the next morning and started to go toward the hill country in Canaan. They said, “We know that we have sinned, but now we are ready to enter the land that Yahweh promised to give to us.”


## Numbers 14:41 (id: 1004014041)

41But Moses said, “Yahweh commanded you to return to the desert, so why are you now disobeying him? It will not succeed.


## Numbers 14:42 (id: 1004014042)

42Do not try to enter the land now! If you try, your enemies will defeat you, because Yahweh will not be with you.


## Numbers 14:43 (id: 1004014043)

43When you begin to fight the descendants of Amalek and Canaan, they will slaughter you! Yahweh will abandon you, because you have abandoned him.”


## Numbers 14:44 (id: 1004014044)

44But even though Moses did not leave the camp, and the sacred chest that contained the Ten Commandments was not taken from the camp, the people began to go toward the hill country in Canaan.


## Numbers 14:45 (id: 1004014045)

45Then the descendants of Amalek and Canaan who lived in those hills came down and attacked them; they chased them as far south as Hormah.


## Numbers 15:1 (id: 1004015001)

1Then Yahweh told Moses,


## Numbers 15:2 (id: 1004015002)

2“Tell this to the Israelite people, ‘When you arrive in the land that I am giving to you,


## Numbers 15:3 (id: 1004015003)

3you must offer to me special sacrifices which will be pleasing to me when the priest burns them on the altar. Some of them may be offerings that will be completely burned on the altar. Some of them may be to indicate that you have made a solemn promise to me. Some of them may be offerings that you yourselves have decided to make. Some of them may be offerings at one of the festivals that you celebrate each year. These offerings may be taken from your herds of cattle or from your flocks of sheep and goats.


## Numbers 15:4 (id: 1004015004)

4When you give these offerings, you must also bring to me a flour offering of about two liters of nice flour mixed with about a liter of olive oil.


## Numbers 15:5 (id: 1004015005)

5When you offer a young ram or goat for the sacrifice that will be completely burned up, or when you offer as a sacrifice of every young lamb, you should prepare a liter of wine to be used as a drink offering.


## Numbers 15:6 (id: 1004015006)

6When you offer a ram to be a sacrifice, you must also bring an offering of about three and four\-fifths liters of finely ground flour mixed with about one and one\-quarter liters of olive oil.


## Numbers 15:7 (id: 1004015007)

7And also pour on the altar about one and one\-fifth liters of wine. While they are being burned, the smell of it will be very pleasing to me.


## Numbers 15:8 (id: 1004015008)

8Sometimes you will offer a young bull to be completely burned on the altar. Sometimes you will offer a sacrifice to indicate that you have made a solemn promise to me. Sometimes you will offer a sacrifice to restore fellowship with me.


## Numbers 15:9 (id: 1004015009)

9When you offer these sacrifices, you must also offer a flour offering of about six and one\-half liters of finely ground flour mixed with about two liters of olive oil.


## Numbers 15:10 (id: 1004015010)

10Also pour on the altar two quarts of wine to be an offering. While those special gifts are being burned, the smell from it will be very pleasing to me.


## Numbers 15:11 (id: 1004015011)

11Each time someone offers a bull or a ram or a male lamb or young goat to be a sacrifice, it must be done that way.


## Numbers 15:12 (id: 1004015012)

12You must obey these instructions for each animal that you bring to me for an offering.


## Numbers 15:13 (id: 1004015013)

13All of you people who have been Israelites all of your lives must obey these regulations when you offer sacrifices that will be pleasing to me when they are burned on the altar.


## Numbers 15:14 (id: 1004015014)

14If any foreigners visit you or live among you, if they also want to bring a sacrifice that will be pleasing to me when it is burned on the altar, they must obey these same instructions.


## Numbers 15:15 (id: 1004015015)

15I consider that those who have always been Israelites and those who are foreigners are equal, and so they must all obey the same instructions. All of your descendants must also continue to obey these instructions of mine.


## Numbers 15:16 (id: 1004015016)

16You Israelites and the foreigners who live among you must all obey the same instructions.’”


## Numbers 15:17 (id: 1004015017)

17Yahweh also said to Moses,


## Numbers 15:18 (id: 1004015018)

18“Tell these instructions to the Israelite people, ‘When you arrive in the land to which I am taking you,


## Numbers 15:19 (id: 1004015019)

19and you eat the crops that are growing there, you must set some of them aside to be a sacred offering to me, and present them to me.


## Numbers 15:20 (id: 1004015020)

20Each year set aside some of the first grain that you gather after you have threshed it. Bake a loaf of bread from the first flour that you grind and present it before me as a sacred offering.


## Numbers 15:21 (id: 1004015021)

21Every year, you and your descendants must continue to make and present to me a loaf of bread baked with flour from the first part of the grain that you harvest.


## Numbers 15:22 (id: 1004015022)

22There may be times when you Israelites do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell you, but not because you intended to disobey them.


## Numbers 15:23 (id: 1004015023)

23There may be times when some of your descendants do not obey all these instructions that I have given to Moses to tell to you.


## Numbers 15:24 (id: 1004015024)

24If you or they sin by forgetting to obey these instructions and none of the Israelite people realize that they were doing that, one young bull as an offering for all the people must be brought to the priest. That will be pleasing to me when it is burned on the altar. They must also bring to me a flour offering and an offering of wine, and a male goat, to be sacrificed to remove the guilt of their sin.


## Numbers 15:25 (id: 1004015025)

25By offering these sacrifices, the priest will make atonement for all of you Israelite people. Then, as a result of their bringing to me an offering to be burned on the altar, you will be forgiven, because you sinned without realizing that you were sinning.


## Numbers 15:26 (id: 1004015026)

26You Israelite people, and the foreigners who are living among you, will all be forgiven.


## Numbers 15:27 (id: 1004015027)

27If one person commits a sin without realizing that he was sinning, that person must bring to me a female goat to be an offering to take away that person’s guilt for that sin.


## Numbers 15:28 (id: 1004015028)

28The priest will offer it to be a sacrifice to remove the guilt of that person’s sin, and that person will be forgiven.


## Numbers 15:29 (id: 1004015029)

29You Israelites and all the foreigners who live among you must obey these same instructions.


## Numbers 15:30 (id: 1004015030)

30But those who disobey my commands deliberately, both Israelites and the foreigners who live among you, have sinned against me by doing that. So they must be expelled from your camp.


## Numbers 15:31 (id: 1004015031)

31They have despised my commands and deliberately disobeyed them, so they must be punished for their sin by never being allowed to live among you again.’”


## Numbers 15:32 (id: 1004015032)

32One day, while the Israelites were in the wilderness, some of them saw a man who was gathering firewood on the Sabbath day.


## Numbers 15:33 (id: 1004015033)

33Those who saw him doing that brought him to Aaron and Moses and the rest of the Israelite people.


## Numbers 15:34 (id: 1004015034)

34They guarded him carefully, because they did not know what to do to punish him.


## Numbers 15:35 (id: 1004015035)

35Then Yahweh said to Moses, “The man must be executed. All of you must kill him by throwing stones at him outside the camp.”


## Numbers 15:36 (id: 1004015036)

36So they all took the man outside the camp and killed him by throwing stones at him, as Yahweh had commanded Moses that they should do.


## Numbers 15:37 (id: 1004015037)

37Yahweh also said to Moses,


## Numbers 15:38 (id: 1004015038)

38“Tell this to the Israelite people: ‘You and all your descendants must twist threads together to make tassels, and then attach them with blue cords to the bottom edges of your clothes.


## Numbers 15:39 (id: 1004015039)

39When you look at the tassels, you will remember all the instructions that I gave to you, and you will obey them. In that way, you will not be unfaithful to me. You will not be like an unfaithful prostitute who does the shameful things that she looks at and desires to do.


## Numbers 15:40 (id: 1004015040)

40Seeing those tassels will help you to remember that you must obey all my commands and that you must be my holy people.


## Numbers 15:41 (id: 1004015041)

41Do not forget that I am Yahweh, your God. I am the one who brought you out of Egypt in order that you might belong to me. I am Yahweh, your God.’”


## Numbers 16:1 (id: 1004016001)

1One day Korah son of Izhar and a descendant of Levi’s son Kohath, conspired with Dathan and Abiram, who were the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth. They were all from the tribe of Reuben.


## Numbers 16:2 (id: 1004016002)

2Those four men incited 250 other people who were leaders among the Israelite people to join them in rebelling against Moses.


## Numbers 16:3 (id: 1004016003)

3They came together to criticize Aaron and Moses. They said to them, “You two are using more authority than you should! Yahweh has set apart all of us Israelite people, and he is with all of us. So why do you act as though you were more important than the rest of us people who belong to Yahweh?”


## Numbers 16:4 (id: 1004016004)

4When Moses heard what they were saying, he prostrated himself on the ground.


## Numbers 16:5 (id: 1004016005)

5Then he said to Korah and those who were with Korah, “Tomorrow morning Yahweh will show to us whom he has chosen to be his priest, and who is holy and allowed to come near to him. Yahweh will permit only those whom he chooses to come into his presence.


## Numbers 16:6 (id: 1004016006)

6So Korah, tomorrow you and those who are with you must prepare your pans to burn incense.


## Numbers 16:7 (id: 1004016007)

7Then you must light a fire in them and burn the incense in the presence of Yahweh. Then we will see which one of us Yahweh has chosen to be his holy servant. It is you men who are descendants of Levi who are trying to use more authority than you should!”


## Numbers 16:8 (id: 1004016008)

8Then Moses spoke again to Korah. He said, “You men who are descendants of Levi, listen to me!


## Numbers 16:9 (id: 1004016009)

9You know that Yahweh, the God of Israel has chosen you Levites from the community of Israel so you can work for him at his sacred tent and serve the people. Does that seem to you like a small thing for you to do?


## Numbers 16:10 (id: 1004016010)

10Yahweh has brought you, Korah, and your fellow descendants of Levi, near to himself. Now are you demanding to become priests also?


## Numbers 16:11 (id: 1004016011)

11It is really Yahweh against whom you and your fellow descendants of Levi are rebelling. Aaron is not the one about whom you are really complaining.”


## Numbers 16:12 (id: 1004016012)

12Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, but they refused to come. They sent a message saying, “We will not come to you!


## Numbers 16:13 (id: 1004016013)

13You brought us out of Egypt, which was a very fertile land, in order to cause us to die here in this desert. That was bad. But now you are also trying to boss us, and that is worse.


## Numbers 16:14 (id: 1004016014)

14You have not given us a new land to live in, a land that has good fields and vineyards. You are only trying to blind these people. So we will not come to you.”


## Numbers 16:15 (id: 1004016015)

15Then Moses became very angry. He said to Yahweh, “Do not accept the grain offerings that they have brought. I have not taken anything from them, not even one donkey, and I have never done anything wrong to them, so they have no reason to complain against me.”


## Numbers 16:16 (id: 1004016016)

16Then Moses said to Korah, “You and all those who are with you must come here tomorrow and stand in front of Yahweh. Aaron will also be here.


## Numbers 16:17 (id: 1004016017)

17You and all the 250 men who are with you must each take a pan in which to burn incense, and put incense in it, to burn it to be an offering to Yahweh. Aaron will do the same thing.”


## Numbers 16:18 (id: 1004016018)

18So each of those men got a pan to burn incense. They put in it incense and hot coals to light it, and then they all stood at the entrance of the sacred tent with Aaron and Moses.


## Numbers 16:19 (id: 1004016019)

19Then Korah summoned all the people who supported him and who were against Moses, and they also gathered at the entrance of the tent. Then the glory of Yahweh appeared to all of them.


## Numbers 16:20 (id: 1004016020)

20Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses,


## Numbers 16:21 (id: 1004016021)

21“Get away from all these people, in order that I can get rid of them immediately!”


## Numbers 16:22 (id: 1004016022)

22But Aaron and Moses prostrated themselves on the ground. They pleaded with Yahweh, saying, “God, you are the one who caused all these people to live. Only one of these men has sinned. So, is it right for you to be angry with all the people?”


## Numbers 16:23 (id: 1004016023)

23Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 16:24 (id: 1004016024)

24“Okay, but tell all the people to get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”


## Numbers 16:25 (id: 1004016025)

25So Moses stood up and went to the tents of Dathan and Abiram. The Israelite leaders followed him.


## Numbers 16:26 (id: 1004016026)

26He told the people, “Get away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that belongs to them! If you touch anything, you will die because of their sins!”


## Numbers 16:27 (id: 1004016027)

27So all the people moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came out of their tents with their wives and children and babies, and stood at the entrance of their tents.


## Numbers 16:28 (id: 1004016028)

28Then Moses said, “I was not the one who decided to do all these things that I have done. It was Yahweh who chose me and sent me to do them. And now he will prove that to you.


## Numbers 16:29 (id: 1004016029)

29If these men die in a normal way, then it will be clear that Yahweh did not choose me.


## Numbers 16:30 (id: 1004016030)

30But if Yahweh does something that has never happened before, if he causes the ground that is under their feet to open up and swallow these men and their families and all their possessions, and they fall into the opening and are buried while they are still alive, then you will know that these men have insulted Yahweh.”


## Numbers 16:31 (id: 1004016031)

31As soon as Moses said this, the ground split open beneath those men.


## Numbers 16:32 (id: 1004016032)

32It swallowed those men and their families and all those who were standing there with Korah and all of their possessions.


## Numbers 16:33 (id: 1004016033)

33They fell into the opening in the ground while they were still alive, and all their possessions fell into the opening also. They disappeared, and the ground closed back up again.


## Numbers 16:34 (id: 1004016034)

34They screamed as they fell, and all the people who were standing nearby heard them scream. The people were terrified and cried out as they ran away, saying, “We do not want the ground to swallow us, also!”


## Numbers 16:35 (id: 1004016035)

35And then a fire from Yahweh came down from the sky and burned up the 250 men who were burning the incense!


## Numbers 16:36 (id: 1004016036)

36Then Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 16:37 (id: 1004016037)

37“Tell Aaron’s son Eleazar to take the pans that had incense in them away from the fire and to scatter the burning coals. The pans that those men were carrying are holy because they burned incense to me in them.


## Numbers 16:38 (id: 1004016038)

38Those men have now died because of their sin. So Eleazar must take their pans and hammer the metal to make it become very thin. He must make a covering for the altar with that metal. Those pans were used to offer incense to me, so they are holy. What happened to those pans will now warn the Israelite people.”


## Numbers 16:39 (id: 1004016039)

39So Eleazar the priest collected the 250 pans for burning incense that had been used by the men who died in the fire. He hammered the pans very thin to make a covering for the altar, as Yahweh told Moses should be done.


## Numbers 16:40 (id: 1004016040)

40Those pans warned the Israelites that only those who were descendants of Aaron were permitted to burn incense as an offering to Yahweh. If anyone else did that, the same thing would happen to him as happened to Korah and those with him.


## Numbers 16:41 (id: 1004016041)

41But the following morning, all the Israelite people started to complain against Aaron and Moses saying “You have killed many people who belonged to Yahweh!”


## Numbers 16:42 (id: 1004016042)

42When all the people gathered together to protest about what Aaron and Moses had done, they looked at the sacred tent and saw that the sacred cloud had covered it, and the glory of Yahweh had appeared.


## Numbers 16:43 (id: 1004016043)

43Aaron and Moses went and stood in front of the sacred tent.


## Numbers 16:44 (id: 1004016044)

44Then Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 16:45 (id: 1004016045)

45“Get away from these people, in order that I can get rid of them immediately without injuring you two!” But Aaron and Moses prostrated themselves on the ground and prayed.


## Numbers 16:46 (id: 1004016046)

46Moses said to Aaron, “Quickly take another pan and put in it some burning coals from the altar. Put incense in the pan, and carry it out among the people to atone for the sins of the people. Yahweh is very angry with them, and I know that a severe plague has already started among them.”


## Numbers 16:47 (id: 1004016047)

47So Aaron did what Moses told him. He took the burning incense out among the people. The plague had already started to strike the people, but Aaron continued to burn the incense to make atonement for the sins of the people.


## Numbers 16:48 (id: 1004016048)

48He stood between the people who had already died and those who were still alive, and then the plague stopped.


## Numbers 16:49 (id: 1004016049)

49But 14, 700 people had already died from that plague, in addition to the people who died with Korah.


## Numbers 16:50 (id: 1004016050)

50Then after the plague had ended, Aaron and Moses returned to the entrance of the sacred tent.


## Numbers 17:1 (id: 1004017001)

1Then Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 17:2 (id: 1004017002)

2“Tell the Israelite people to bring to you twelve walking sticks. They should bring one from each of the leaders of the twelve tribes. You should carve each leader’s name on his stick.


## Numbers 17:3 (id: 1004017003)

3There must be one stick for the leader of each tribe, so you must carve Aaron’s name on the stick for the tribe of Levi.


## Numbers 17:4 (id: 1004017004)

4Put those walking sticks inside the sacred tent, in front of the sacred chest that has in it the tablets on which the Ten Commandments are written. That is the place where I always talk with you.


## Numbers 17:5 (id: 1004017005)

5Buds will sprout on the stick of the man whom I have chosen to be the priest. When the people see that, they will stop their constantly complaining about you because they will realize that he is the one whom I have chosen.”


## Numbers 17:6 (id: 1004017006)

6So Moses told the people what Yahweh had said. Then each of the twelve Israelite leaders, including Aaron, brought his walking stick to Moses.


## Numbers 17:7 (id: 1004017007)

7Moses placed the sticks inside the sacred tent in front of the sacred chest.


## Numbers 17:8 (id: 1004017008)

8The following morning, when he went into the tent, he saw that Aaron’s stick, which represented the tribe of Levi, had sprouted. It had produced leaves and blossoms, and it had also produced almonds that were ripe!


## Numbers 17:9 (id: 1004017009)

9Moses brought all the sticks out of the sacred tent and showed them to the people. Each of the twelve leaders took back his own stick.


## Numbers 17:10 (id: 1004017010)

10Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s stick in front of the sacred chest, and let it stay there permanently. That will be a warning to people who want to rebel against me. Then no more people will die because of complaining against me.”


## Numbers 17:11 (id: 1004017011)

11So Moses did what Yahweh had commanded.


## Numbers 17:12 (id: 1004017012)

12Then the Israelite people said to Moses, “We are going to die! All of us are surely going to die!


## Numbers 17:13 (id: 1004017013)

13Everyone who comes close to Yahweh’s sacred tent dies. Are the rest of us going to die, also?”


## Numbers 18:1 (id: 1004018001)

1Yahweh said to Aaron, “You and your sons and the other members of your father’s family are the ones who will be punished if anything bad happens to the things inside the sacred tent. And you and your sons will be punished if any priest does something bad.


## Numbers 18:2 (id: 1004018002)

2Require that those who belong to your tribe, the tribe of Levi, must assist you and your sons while you perform your work at the sacred tent.


## Numbers 18:3 (id: 1004018003)

3But while they do that work, they must not go near the sacred items inside the tent or near the altar. If they do that, they will die, and you will die, too!


## Numbers 18:4 (id: 1004018004)

4They may assist you in doing all the work to take care of the sacred tent, but no one else is permitted to come near the place where you are working.


## Numbers 18:5 (id: 1004018005)

5You are the ones who will do the sacred work inside the sacred tent and at the altar. If you obey these instructions, I will not become very angry with the Israelite people again.


## Numbers 18:6 (id: 1004018006)

6I myself have chosen the descendants of Levi from the other Israelites in order that they may be your special helpers. They are like a gift that I have given you to work at the sacred tent.


## Numbers 18:7 (id: 1004018007)

7But it is you and your sons, who are the priests, who must perform all the details I have commanded concerning the altar and with what happens inside the Very Holy Place. I am giving to you this work of serving as priests. So anyone else who tries to do that work must be executed.”


## Numbers 18:8 (id: 1004018008)

8Yahweh also said to Aaron, “I myself have appointed you to take care of all the sacred offerings that the Israelite people bring to me. I have given all these sacred offerings to you and to your sons. You and your descendants will get a share of these offerings permanently.


## Numbers 18:9 (id: 1004018009)

9The parts of the offerings that are not completely burned on the altar belong to you. Those parts of the sacred offerings, including the flour offerings, the offerings to make atonement for sins and to remove the guilt of sins, I require that they be set apart. I require that they be given to you and to your sons.


## Numbers 18:10 (id: 1004018010)

10You are to eat it as a most holy offering. Every male in your clan may eat it. But you must have respect for those offerings because they are holy to you.


## Numbers 18:11 (id: 1004018011)

11The priests lift up high the sacred offerings while they are standing in front of the altar. All of those offerings that the Israelites present to me belong to you and your sons and daughters. They will always be your share. All the members of your family who have performed the rituals to cause them to be acceptable to me are permitted to eat from these offerings.


## Numbers 18:12 (id: 1004018012)

12I am also giving to you the first food that people harvest each year and bring to me—the best olive oil and new wine and grain.


## Numbers 18:13 (id: 1004018013)

13All of the first crops that people harvest and bring to me belong to you. Anyone in your family who has performed the ritual to become acceptable to me is permitted to eat that food.


## Numbers 18:14 (id: 1004018014)

14Everything in Israel that is devoted to me, will be yours.


## Numbers 18:15 (id: 1004018015)

15The firstborn males, both humans and domestic animals, that are offered to me, will be yours. But people must buy back their firstborn sons and the firstborn animals that may not be used for sacrifices.


## Numbers 18:16 (id: 1004018016)

16They must buy them back when they are one month old. The price that they must pay for each one is five pieces of silver. They must weigh the silver on the scales that are in the sacred tent.


## Numbers 18:17 (id: 1004018017)

17I do not permit you to buy back the firstborn cattle or sheep or goats. They are holy and I require you to set them apart for me. Slaughter them and sprinkle their blood on the altar. Then completely burn the fat of those animals on the altar to be an offering to me. The smell as they burn will be very pleasing to me.


## Numbers 18:18 (id: 1004018018)

18The meat from those offerings will be yours, just like the breast and right thigh of animals that are presented to me to restore fellowship with me, as the priest lifts them up high in front of the altar, are yours.


## Numbers 18:19 (id: 1004018019)

19Anything that the Israelite people present to me as holy gifts, I am giving to you. They are for you and your sons and daughters to eat. They will always be your share. This is an agreement that I am making with you, an agreement that will last forever. I am also making this agreement with your descendants.”


## Numbers 18:20 (id: 1004018020)

20Yahweh also said to Aaron, “You priests will not receive any of the land or the property like the other Israelite people will receive. I am what you will receive.


## Numbers 18:21 (id: 1004018021)

21When the Israelite people bring to me a tenth of all the crops and of their newborn animals, I will give that to you descendants of Levi. That will be your payment for the work you do at the sacred tent.


## Numbers 18:22 (id: 1004018022)

22The other Israelites must not go near that tent. If they go near it, I will consider that their doing that is a sin, and they will die for committing that sin.


## Numbers 18:23 (id: 1004018023)

23Only the descendants of Levi are permitted to work at the sacred tent, and they will be punished if anything bad happens to it. That is a law that will never be changed. You descendants of Levi will not receive any land to own among all the other Israelite people.


## Numbers 18:24 (id: 1004018024)

24The Israelites must present one tenth of all their crops and animals as offerings to me, and that is what I give to the descendents of Levi so they can provide for themselves. This is why I said that I will not give the descendants of Levi any land to own.”


## Numbers 18:25 (id: 1004018025)

25Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 18:26 (id: 1004018026)

26“Tell this to the descendants of Levi, ‘When you receive one tenth of all the crops and animals from the Israelite people, you must present one tenth of all that to me to be a sacred offering,


## Numbers 18:27 (id: 1004018027)

27just like the other Israelites present one tenth of the grain and wine that they produce.


## Numbers 18:28 (id: 1004018028)

28You must present to me one tenth of all that you receive from the Israelite people. That will be your sacred offering to me. You must present it to Aaron.


## Numbers 18:29 (id: 1004018029)

29Select the best parts of the things that are given to you to present them to me.’


## Numbers 18:30 (id: 1004018030)

30Also, tell this to the descendants of Levi, ‘When you present those best portions of grain and wine as your offering to me, I will consider that those gifts are as though they came from your own grain and wine.


## Numbers 18:31 (id: 1004018031)

31You descendants of Levi and your families are permitted to eat the rest of that food, and you may eat it wherever you want to, because it is your payment for the work that you do at the sacred tent.


## Numbers 18:32 (id: 1004018032)

32If you give to the priests the best portions of what you receive, you will not be punished by me for accepting one tenth of the gifts that the people bring to me. But you must consider those gifts to be sacred. If you sin by eating those things in ways that are contrary to these regulations that I have given to you, you will be executed.’”


## Numbers 19:1 (id: 1004019001)

1Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses,


## Numbers 19:2 (id: 1004019002)

2“I am now giving to you another regulation. Tell the Israelite people to bring to you one reddish brown cow that has no defects. It must be an animal that has never been used for plowing ground.


## Numbers 19:3 (id: 1004019003)

3Give it to Eleazar the priest. He must take it outside the camp and someone will slaughter it.


## Numbers 19:4 (id: 1004019004)

4And Eleazar must dip one of his fingers in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times on the ground near the sacred tent.


## Numbers 19:5 (id: 1004019005)

5Then, while Eleazar watches, the cow must be burned completely—its hide, its meat, the rest of its blood, and even its dung.


## Numbers 19:6 (id: 1004019006)

6Eliezer then must take a stick of cedar wood, a stalk of a plant named hyssop, and some scarlet yarn, and throw them into the fire where the cow is burning.


## Numbers 19:7 (id: 1004019007)

7Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe. After doing that, he may return to the camp. But he will be unfit for doing any sacred work until that evening.


## Numbers 19:8 (id: 1004019008)

8The man who burns the cow must also wash his clothes and bathe, and he will also be unacceptable to me until that evening.


## Numbers 19:9 (id: 1004019009)

9Then someone who has not become unacceptable to me must gather up the ashes of the cow and put them in a sacred place outside the camp. The ashes must be kept there for the people of Israel to use when they mix it with water for the ritual to remove the guilt of sin.


## Numbers 19:10 (id: 1004019010)

10The man who gathers up the ashes of the cow must also wash his clothes, and he also will be unfit to do anymore sacred work until that evening. That is a regulation that will never be changed. It must be obeyed by you Israelite people and by any foreigners who live among you.


## Numbers 19:11 (id: 1004019011)

11All those who touch a corpse will be unacceptable to me for seven days.


## Numbers 19:12 (id: 1004019012)

12On the third day and on the seventh day after touching a corpse, in order to become acceptable to me again, they must sprinkle on themselves some of that water for removing the guilt of their sin. If they do not do that on both of those days, they will continue to be unacceptable to me.


## Numbers 19:13 (id: 1004019013)

13All those who touch a corpse, and do not perform in the correct way the ritual to become acceptable to me again, defile Yahweh’s sacred tent. They will no longer be permitted to live among the Israelite people. The water to remove the guilt of sin was not sprinkled on them, so they continue to be unacceptable to me.


## Numbers 19:14 (id: 1004019014)

14There is another practice that must be performed when someone dies inside a tent. All those who were inside that tent when that person died or who enter that tent will be unacceptable to me for seven days.


## Numbers 19:15 (id: 1004019015)

15Any jars that are inside that tent that are not covered are not permitted to be used.


## Numbers 19:16 (id: 1004019016)

16If someone who is out in a field touches the corpse of someone who was murdered, or who died from natural causes, or if someone touches a bone from some human or touches a grave, that person will be unacceptable to me for seven days.


## Numbers 19:17 (id: 1004019017)

17For someone like that to become acceptable to me again, some of the ashes from the cow that was burned must be taken and put in a jar. Then some fresh water must be poured over the ashes.


## Numbers 19:18 (id: 1004019018)

18Then someone who has not become unacceptable to me must take a stalk of a plant named hyssop and dip it into the water. Then that person must sprinkle some of the water on the tent where that person died, on the things that are in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent. He must also sprinkle some of that water on any person who touched a human bone or who touched a person who had been killed, or who touched a person who died of natural causes, or who touched a grave.


## Numbers 19:19 (id: 1004019019)

19On the third day and on the seventh day after that, the person who is acceptable to me must sprinkle some of that water on those who have become unacceptable to me. On the seventh day, the people who are performing that ritual to become acceptable to me again must wash their clothes and bathe. If they do that, on that evening they will become acceptable to me again.


## Numbers 19:20 (id: 1004019020)

20If those who have become unacceptable to me do not become acceptable to me again by doing this, they will no longer be permitted to live among to the Israelite people, because they have defiled my sacred tent. They did not sprinkle on themselves the water that removes the guilt of their sins, so they remain unacceptable to me.


## Numbers 19:21 (id: 1004019021)

21That is a law for the Israelite people that will never be changed. Those who sprinkle that water on themselves must then wash their clothes. And anyone who touches that water which removes guilt for sins will remain unacceptable to God until that evening.


## Numbers 19:22 (id: 1004019022)

22Anything and any person that someone who has become unacceptable to me has touched will remain unacceptable to me until that evening.”


## Numbers 20:1 (id: 1004020001)

1In the first month of the next year, the Israelite people traveled to the wilderness of Zin and camped near Kadesh. While they were there, Moses’ sister Miriam died and was buried there.


## Numbers 20:2 (id: 1004020002)

2There was no water for the people to drink there, so they came to Aaron and Moses.


## Numbers 20:3 (id: 1004020003)

3They complained and said, “We wish that we had died in front of Yahweh’s sacred tent when our fellow Israelites died!


## Numbers 20:4 (id: 1004020004)

4Did you bring us, who are Yahweh’s people, into this desert to die along with our livestock?


## Numbers 20:5 (id: 1004020005)

5Why did you bring us from Egypt to this miserable place? There is no grain, there are no figs, no grapes, and no pomegranates here. And there is no water for us to drink!”


## Numbers 20:6 (id: 1004020006)

6Moses and Aaron turned away from the people and went to the entrance of the sacred tent and prostrated themselves on the ground. Just then Yahweh appeared to them with his bright glory.


## Numbers 20:7 (id: 1004020007)

7When Yahweh appeared in glory, he said,


## Numbers 20:8 (id: 1004020008)

8“You and Aaron must take Aaron’s walking stick with you and gather all the people together. While the people are watching, command that large rock over there to pour out water. Water for the people will flow from it. All they and all their livestock will have enough water to drink.”


## Numbers 20:9 (id: 1004020009)

9So Moses did what Yahweh told him to do. He took Aaron’s walking stick from the place in the sacred tent where it was kept.


## Numbers 20:10 (id: 1004020010)

10Then Moses and Aaron summoned all the people to gather at the rock. Then Moses shouted to them, “All you rebellious people, listen! Is it necessary for us to bring to you water from this rock?”


## Numbers 20:11 (id: 1004020011)

11Then Moses raised his hand and instead of speaking to the rock, he struck the rock two times with the walking stick. And water gushed out. So all the people and their livestock drank all the water that they wanted.


## Numbers 20:12 (id: 1004020012)

12But Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses, “You did not trust me or honor me before the people of Israel, and so you will not lead them into the land I have given to them!”


## Numbers 20:13 (id: 1004020013)

13Later this place was called the Meribah, which means ‘arguing’, because there the Israelite people argued against Yahweh, and there he showed his honor and holiness to them by giving them water.


## Numbers 20:14 (id: 1004020014)

14While the people were at Kadesh, Moses sent messengers to the king of Edom to tell him this, “Your relatives, the Israelite people, are sending you this message. You know the many troubles that have happened to us.


## Numbers 20:15 (id: 1004020015)

15You know that our ancestors went down to Egypt. You know that they stayed there for many years. They suffered because the rulers of Egypt caused them to become their slaves and to work very hard.


## Numbers 20:16 (id: 1004020016)

16But when they called out to Yahweh, he heard them and sent an angel who brought them out of Egypt. Now we have set up our tents here at Kadesh, a town on the border of your land.


## Numbers 20:17 (id: 1004020017)

17Please allow us to travel through your country. We will be careful to not walk through your fields and your vineyards. We will not even drink water from your wells. As we travel, we will stay on the king’s highway, the main road that goes from the south to the north, and we will not leave that road until we have crossed the border of your country in the north.”


## Numbers 20:18 (id: 1004020018)

18But the king of Edom refused. He replied, “Stay out of my country! If you try to enter it, I will send my army to attack you!”


## Numbers 20:19 (id: 1004020019)

19The Israelite messengers replied, “If we travel through your country, we will stay on the main road. If we and any of our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We want only to travel through your country. We do not want anything else.”


## Numbers 20:20 (id: 1004020020)

20But the king replied, “No! Stay out of our country! We will not allow you to travel through our land!” Then he sent the strongest soldiers in his army to prevent the Israelites from entering his country.


## Numbers 20:21 (id: 1004020021)

21So, because the king of Edom refused to allow the Israelites to travel through his country, the Israelites turned and traveled a different way.


## Numbers 20:22 (id: 1004020022)

22The Israelite people left Kadesh. They went to Mount Hor,


## Numbers 20:23 (id: 1004020023)

23which is at the border of Edom. While they were there, Yahweh said to Aaron and Moses,


## Numbers 20:24 (id: 1004020024)

24“It is time for Aaron to die. He will not enter the land that I am giving to you Israelites, because the two of you disobeyed me when I told you to speak to the rock to cause the water to flow at Meribah.


## Numbers 20:25 (id: 1004020025)

25Now you, Moses, take Aaron and his son Eleazar up on Mount Hor.


## Numbers 20:26 (id: 1004020026)

26There you must remove Aaron’s clothes that he wears when he does the works of a priest, and put them on his son, Eleazar. Aaron will die up there.”


## Numbers 20:27 (id: 1004020027)

27So Moses did what Yahweh commanded. The three of them climbed up Mount Hor, while all the Israelite people watched.


## Numbers 20:28 (id: 1004020028)

28At the top of the mountain, Moses took off the clothes that Aaron wore while he did the work of a priest and put them on Eleazar. Then Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Eleazar and Moses went back down.


## Numbers 20:29 (id: 1004020029)

29When the Israelite people realized that Aaron had died, they all mourned for him for thirty days.


## Numbers 21:1 (id: 1004021001)

1The king of the city of Arad lived in the area where the Canaanites lived, in the southern Judean wilderness. He heard a report that the Israelites were approaching on the road to Atharim village. So his army attacked the Israelites and captured some of them.


## Numbers 21:2 (id: 1004021002)

2Then the Israelites declared this solemnly, “Yahweh, if you will help us to defeat these people, we will completely destroy all their towns.”


## Numbers 21:3 (id: 1004021003)

3Yahweh heard what they requested, and he enabled them to defeat the army of this Canaan people group. The Israelite soldiers killed all the people and destroyed their towns. Ever since that time, that place has been called Hormah which means “destruction.”


## Numbers 21:4 (id: 1004021004)

4Then the Israelites left Mount Hor and traveled on the road toward the Sea of Reeds, in order to go around the land of Edom. But the people became impatient along the way,


## Numbers 21:5 (id: 1004021005)

5and they began to grumble against God and against Moses. They said, “Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in this desert? There is nothing to eat here, and nothing to drink. And we detest this lousy manna food!”


## Numbers 21:6 (id: 1004021006)

6So Yahweh sent poisonous snakes among them. Many of the people were bitten by the snakes and died.


## Numbers 21:7 (id: 1004021007)

7Then the people came to Moses and cried out, saying, “We now know that we have sinned against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, asking that he will take away the snakes!” So Moses prayed for the people.


## Numbers 21:8 (id: 1004021008)

8Then Yahweh told him, “Make a model of a poisonous snake, and attach it to the top of a pole. If those who are bitten by the snakes look at that model, they will recover.”


## Numbers 21:9 (id: 1004021009)

9So Moses made a snake from bronze and attached it to the top of a pole. Then, when those who had been bitten by a snake looked at the bronze snake, they recovered!


## Numbers 21:10 (id: 1004021010)

10Then the Israelites traveled to Oboth and camped there.


## Numbers 21:11 (id: 1004021011)

11Then they left Oboth and went to Iye Abarim in the wilderness on the eastern border of Moab.


## Numbers 21:12 (id: 1004021012)

12From there they traveled to the valley where the Zered riverbed is, and camped there.


## Numbers 21:13 (id: 1004021013)

13Then they traveled to the north side of the Arnon River. That area is in the wilderness next to the land where the Amorites live. The Arnon River is the boundary between Moab and where the Amorites live.


## Numbers 21:14 (id: 1004021014)

14That is why it is written down in the book of the wars of Yahweh, “Waheb in Suphah, and the ravines there, and the Arnon River


## Numbers 21:15 (id: 1004021015)

15and the ravines there, which extend as far as Ar village on the border of Moab.”


## Numbers 21:16 (id: 1004021016)

16From there the Israelites traveled to Beer. There was a well there where Yahweh previously had said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.”


## Numbers 21:17 (id: 1004021017)

17There the Israelites sang this song: “O well, give us water! Sing about this well!


## Numbers 21:18 (id: 1004021018)

18Sing about this well which our leaders dug; they dug out the dirt with their royal scepters and their walking sticks.” Then the Israelites left that wilderness and went through Mattanah.


## Numbers 21:19 (id: 1004021019)

19The Israelites also went through Nahaliel, and Bamoth village.


## Numbers 21:20 (id: 1004021020)

20Then they went to the valley in Moab where Mount Pisgah rises above the wilderness.


## Numbers 21:21 (id: 1004021021)

21Then the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon, the king of the Amor people group. This was the message that they gave him,


## Numbers 21:22 (id: 1004021022)

22“Allow us to travel through your country. We will stay on the king’s highway, the main road that goes from the south to the north, until we have finished traveling through your land. We will not walk through any field or vineyard, or drink water from your wells.”


## Numbers 21:23 (id: 1004021023)

23But King Sihon refused. He would not allow them to walk through his land. Instead, he sent his whole army to attack the Israelites in the desert. They attacked the Israelites at Jahaz village.


## Numbers 21:24 (id: 1004021024)

24But the Israelites completely defeated them and occupied their land, from the Arnon River in the south to the Jabbok River in the north. They stopped at the border of the land where the Ammon people group lived, because the Ammon army was defending the border strongly.


## Numbers 21:25 (id: 1004021025)

25So the Israelites occupied all the cities and towns where the Amorites lived, and some of the Israelites began to live in them. They occupied the city of Heshbon and the nearby villages.


## Numbers 21:26 (id: 1004021026)

26Heshbon was the capital of the country. It was the city where King Sihon ruled. His army had previously defeated the army of the king of Moab, and then his people had begun to live in all of the land of Moab as far as the Arnon River in the south.


## Numbers 21:27 (id: 1004021027)

27For that reason, one of the poets wrote long ago, “Come to Heshbon, the city where King Sihon ruled. We want the city to be restored.


## Numbers 21:28 (id: 1004021028)

28A fire blazed from Heshbon. It burned down the city of Ar in Moab. It destroyed everything on the hills along the Arnon River.


## Numbers 21:29 (id: 1004021029)

29You people of Moab, terrible things have happened to you! You people who worship your god Chemosh have been annihilated! The men who worshiped Chemosh have run away and are now refugees, and the women who worshiped him have been captured by the army of Sihon, the king of the Amor people group.


## Numbers 21:30 (id: 1004021030)

30But we have defeated those descendants of Amor, all the way from Heshbon in the north to the city of Dibon in the south. We have completely obliterated them as far as the cities of Nophah and Medeba.”


## Numbers 21:31 (id: 1004021031)

31So the Israelite people began to live in the land where the Amorites lived.


## Numbers 21:32 (id: 1004021032)

32After Moses sent some men to explore the area near the city of Jazer, Israelite people began to live in all the towns in that region and expelled the Amor people group who lived there.


## Numbers 21:33 (id: 1004021033)

33Then they turned north toward the region of Bashan, but King Og of Bashan and all his army attacked them at the city of Edrei.


## Numbers 21:34 (id: 1004021034)

34Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of Og, because I am going to enable your men to defeat him and his army, and to take possession of all his land. You will do to him what you did to Sihon, the king of the Amor people group, who ruled in Heshbon.”


## Numbers 21:35 (id: 1004021035)

35And that is what happened. The Israelites defeated Og’s army, and killed King Og and his sons and all his people. Not a person survived! And then the Israelites began to live in their land.


## Numbers 22:1 (id: 1004022001)

1Then the Israelites traveled west to the plain of Moab that was in the Valley of the Jordan River, across the river from Jericho.


## Numbers 22:2 (id: 1004022002)

2But King Balak son of Zippor, who ruled Moab, found out what the Israelites had done to the Amor people group.


## Numbers 22:3 (id: 1004022003)

3When he saw that the Israelites were very numerous, he and his people became terrified.


## Numbers 22:4 (id: 1004022004)

4So the king of Moab went to the leaders of the Midian people group and said to them, “This huge group of Israelites will wipe out everything around them, like an ox devours grass!” Balak was the king of Moab.


## Numbers 22:5 (id: 1004022005)

5He sent messengers to a prophet named Balaam, who was living in his own area, in Pethor, near the Euphrates River. He sent this message to request that Balaam would come to help him, “A huge group of people has arrived here from Egypt. It looks like they are covering the entire land! And they have begun to live close to us.


## Numbers 22:6 (id: 1004022006)

6Because they are very powerful, we are afraid of them. So please come and curse them for me. Then my army may be able to defeat them and expel them from the land where they are now living. I know that good things will happen to the people whom you bless, and disasters will happen to the people whom you curse.”


## Numbers 22:7 (id: 1004022007)

7Balak’s messengers, who were leaders of both the Moab and Midian people groups, took money with them to pay Balaam in order that he would come and curse the Israelites. They went to Balaam and told him what Balak had said.


## Numbers 22:8 (id: 1004022008)

8Balaam said, “Stay here tonight. Tomorrow morning I will tell you whatever Yahweh tells me that I should say to you.” So the leaders from Moab stayed there that night.


## Numbers 22:9 (id: 1004022009)

9During the night, God appeared to Balaam and asked him, “Who are these men who are staying with you?”


## Numbers 22:10 (id: 1004022010)

10Balaam replied, “Balak, the king of Moab, sent these men to tell me this message,


## Numbers 22:11 (id: 1004022011)

11‘A huge group of people has come from Egypt, and they have spread all over this area. Please come immediately to curse them. Then I may be able to defeat them and expel them from this area.’”


## Numbers 22:12 (id: 1004022012)

12God replied to Balaam, “Do not go with them! I have blessed those people, so you must not curse them!”


## Numbers 22:13 (id: 1004022013)

13The next morning, Balaam got up and told Balak’s men, “Go back home. But go by yourselves, because Yahweh is not allowing me to go with you.”


## Numbers 22:14 (id: 1004022014)

14So the men from Moab returned to King Balak and they reported to him, “Balaam refused to come with us.”


## Numbers 22:15 (id: 1004022015)

15But Balak sent another group of leaders to Balaam. It was a group that was larger and they were more important than the men in the first group.


## Numbers 22:16 (id: 1004022016)

16They went to Balaam and told him this, “This is what King Balak says, ‘Please do not allow anything to hinder you from coming here.


## Numbers 22:17 (id: 1004022017)

17I will pay you a lot of money if you come, and I will do anything that you ask me to do. Just come and curse these Israelite people for me!’”


## Numbers 22:18 (id: 1004022018)

18But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak would give me a palace filled with silver and gold, I would not do anything to disobey Yahweh, my God.


## Numbers 22:19 (id: 1004022019)

19But stay here one more night, like the other messengers did, and I will find out if Yahweh has anything more to say to me.”


## Numbers 22:20 (id: 1004022020)

20That night God appeared to Balaam again and said to him, “These men have come to request that you go back with them, so you may go with them, but do only what I tell you to do!”


## Numbers 22:21 (id: 1004022021)

21So the next morning, Balaam put a saddle on his donkey and he departed with two of his servants along with the men from Moab.


## Numbers 22:22 (id: 1004022022)

22Even though God had given Balaam permission to go, he was still angry. So he sent one of his angels to Balaam. This angel stood in the road to block Balaam’s path. As Balaam and the two servants were riding on their donkeys,


## Numbers 22:23 (id: 1004022023)

23Balaam’s donkey saw the angel. The angel was standing in the road and was holding a sword in his hand, but Balaam did not see him. Balaam’s donkey turned off the road into a field. So Balaam struck the donkey and forced it to go back onto the road.


## Numbers 22:24 (id: 1004022024)

24Then the angel stood in a place where the road was very narrow, between two vineyards, with walls on each side of the road.


## Numbers 22:25 (id: 1004022025)

25When the donkey saw the angel standing there, it walked very close to the wall to try to get past the angel. As a result, it bashed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So Balaam struck the donkey again.


## Numbers 22:26 (id: 1004022026)

26Then the angel went further along the road and stood at a place that was extremely narrow, with the result that the donkey could not get past at all.


## Numbers 22:27 (id: 1004022027)

27This time, when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down on the ground with Balaam sitting on top of it. Balaam became extremely angry, and he struck the donkey again with his walking stick.


## Numbers 22:28 (id: 1004022028)

28Then Yahweh enabled the donkey to speak! It said to Balaam, “What bad thing have I done to you that caused you to strike me three times?”


## Numbers 22:29 (id: 1004022029)

29Balaam shouted, “I struck you because you have caused me to appear to be foolish! If I had a sword with me, I would kill you!”


## Numbers 22:30 (id: 1004022030)

30But the donkey answered, “I am your own donkey, the one that you have always ridden! Have I ever done anything like this previously?” Balaam said, “No.”


## Numbers 22:31 (id: 1004022031)

31Then Yahweh enabled Balaam to see the angel standing on the road, holding a sword in his hand. Balaam realized that it was an angel and prostrated himself on the ground in front of the angel.


## Numbers 22:32 (id: 1004022032)

32The angel asked him, “Why did you strike your donkey three times? I have come to block your path because what you are planning to do is wrong.


## Numbers 22:33 (id: 1004022033)

33Three times your donkey saw me and turned away from me. If it had not done that, I would certainly have killed you already, but I would have allowed the donkey to live.”


## Numbers 22:34 (id: 1004022034)

34Then Balaam said to the angel, “I have sinned. But I did not realize that you were standing there, trying to block my path. So if you do not want me to continue going, I will return home.”


## Numbers 22:35 (id: 1004022035)

35But the angel replied, “I will allow you to go with these men, but you must say only what I tell you to say!” So Balaam went on with the leaders whom Balak had sent.


## Numbers 22:36 (id: 1004022036)

36When King Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went to meet him at a city in Moab that is located alongside the Arnon River, near the border of his own land.


## Numbers 22:37 (id: 1004022037)

37When he arrived where Balaam was, he said to him, “I sent you a message saying that you should come immediately! Why did you not come? Did you think that I was not able to pay you a lot of money for coming?”


## Numbers 22:38 (id: 1004022038)

38Balaam replied, “I have come here now, but I am not able to say anything that I want to. I will say only the words that God tells me to say.”


## Numbers 22:39 (id: 1004022039)

39Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.


## Numbers 22:40 (id: 1004022040)

40There Balak killed some cattle and sheep as sacrifices, and offered parts of the meat to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.


## Numbers 22:41 (id: 1004022041)

41They slept there, and the next morning Balak took Balaam part way up the mountain to Bamoth Baal village. From there, they could see some of the Israelite people who were down below.


## Numbers 23:1 (id: 1004023001)

1Balaam said to King Balak, “Build here seven altars for me. Then kill seven young bulls and seven rams for a sacrifice.”


## Numbers 23:2 (id: 1004023002)

2So Balak did that. And then he and Balaam each burned a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.


## Numbers 23:3 (id: 1004023003)

3Then Balaam said to Balak, “You stand here close to your burned offerings, and I will go and ask Yahweh if he has something else to tell me. Then I will tell you what he says to me.” Then Balaam went by himself to the top of a hill.


## Numbers 23:4 (id: 1004023004)

4While he was on the top of the hill, God appeared to him there. Balaam said to him, “We have built seven altars, and I have killed and burned a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice to you on each altar.”


## Numbers 23:5 (id: 1004023005)

5Then Yahweh gave Balaam a message to give to King Balak. Then he said, “Go back and tell him what I told you.”


## Numbers 23:6 (id: 1004023006)

6When Balaam returned to Balak, Balak was standing with the leaders from Moab beside the offerings he had burned on the altar.


## Numbers 23:7 (id: 1004023007)

7This is the message that Balaam told them, “Balak summoned me to come here from Aram; the king of Moab brought me here from the hills at the eastern side of Aram. He said, ‘Come and curse the descendants of Jacob for me! Come and say that bad things will happen to these Israelite people!’


## Numbers 23:8 (id: 1004023008)

8But how can I curse people whom God has not cursed? How can I fight against people against whom Yahweh does not fight?


## Numbers 23:9 (id: 1004023009)

9I have seen them from the tops of the rocky peaks, I have seen them from the hills. I see that they are a group of people who live by themselves. They have separated themselves from other nations.


## Numbers 23:10 (id: 1004023010)

10Who can count the descendants of Jacob, as numerous as particles of dust! Who can count even a fourth of the number of the Israelite people? I wish that I will die like righteous people die. I hope that I will die peacefully like they will die.”


## Numbers 23:11 (id: 1004023011)

11Then Balak said, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but instead you have blessed them!”


## Numbers 23:12 (id: 1004023012)

12But Balaam replied, “I can say only what Yahweh tells me to say. I cannot say anything else.”


## Numbers 23:13 (id: 1004023013)

13Then King Balak told Balaam, “Come with me to another place. There you will see only part of the Israelite people, and you will be able to curse those people for me.”


## Numbers 23:14 (id: 1004023014)

14So Balak took Balaam to a field on the top of Mount Pisgah. There, again he built seven altars and offered a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.


## Numbers 23:15 (id: 1004023015)

15Then Balaam said to the king, “Stand here close to your burned offerings, while I go and talk with Yahweh.”


## Numbers 23:16 (id: 1004023016)

16So Balaam did that, and Yahweh appeared to Balaam again and gave him another message. Then he said, “Go back to Balak and tell him that message.”


## Numbers 23:17 (id: 1004023017)

17So Balaam returned to where the king and the leaders from Moab were standing, next to the altar where Balak had burned the sacrifices. Balak asked him, “What did Yahweh say?”


## Numbers 23:18 (id: 1004023018)

18Then Balaam told him this message, “Balak, listen carefully, hear what I have to say, you son of Zippor!


## Numbers 23:19 (id: 1004023019)

19God is not a human being. Humans lie, but God never lies. He never changes his mind, as humans do. Whatever he has said that he will do, he does. Whatever he has promised to do, he has done it.


## Numbers 23:20 (id: 1004023020)

20He commanded me to request him to bless the Israelites, So he has blessed them, and I cannot change that.


## Numbers 23:21 (id: 1004023021)

21Yahweh their God is with them; the people shout that he is their true king. So the descendants of Jacob will not be harmed, they will not endure trouble without God.


## Numbers 23:22 (id: 1004023022)

22God brought them out slavery in Egypt and has led them through the wilderness with strength like a wild ox.


## Numbers 23:23 (id: 1004023023)

23When people curse the descendants of Jacob, they will not be harmed, when people work sorcery on them, it will have no power. So now people will say about the descendants of Jacob, ‘God has done wonderful things for the Israelites!’


## Numbers 23:24 (id: 1004023024)

24They are very strong, like lionesses that are ready to attack other animals. They stand firm like lions. The lions refuse to rest until they have killed and eaten their prey and drunk the blood of the animals they slaughtered.”


## Numbers 23:25 (id: 1004023025)

25Then Balak said to Balaam, “If you will not curse them, then I certainly do not want you to bless them!”


## Numbers 23:26 (id: 1004023026)

26But Balaam replied, “I told you that I must do only what Yahweh tells me to do!”


## Numbers 23:27 (id: 1004023027)

27Then King Balak said to Balaam, “Come with me; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to allow you to curse them from that place.”


## Numbers 23:28 (id: 1004023028)

28So Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor where they could look down and see the Israelites in the desert.


## Numbers 23:29 (id: 1004023029)

29Balaam again told Balak, “Build me seven altars again and kill seven young bulls and seven rams for a sacrifice.”


## Numbers 23:30 (id: 1004023030)

30So Balak did what Balaam told him to do. He burned a young bull and a ram on each altar as sacrifices.


## Numbers 24:1 (id: 1004024001)

1Balaam now realized that Yahweh wanted to bless the Israelite people, not curse them. So he did not use magic like a shaman would do to find out what Yahweh wanted, as he often did. Instead, he turned toward the desert.


## Numbers 24:2 (id: 1004024002)

2He saw the Israelite people camped there in their tents, with each tribe gathered in one group. Then the Spirit of God came upon him,


## Numbers 24:3 (id: 1004024003)

3and this is the prophetic message that he gave to Balak: “I, Balaam son of Beor, am giving this prophecy. This prophecy that I speak is as a man who sees what will happen in the future clearly speaks.


## Numbers 24:4 (id: 1004024004)

4I hear this message from God. I see a vision from the one who is all\-powerful. My eyes are open as I prostrate myself in front of him.


## Numbers 24:5 (id: 1004024005)

5You descendants of Jacob, your tents are very beautiful! The places where you live are lovely!


## Numbers 24:6 (id: 1004024006)

6Your tents are spread out in front of me like groves of palm trees in valleys, like gardens alongside a river. They are like strong aloe trees that Yahweh has planted, like strong cedar trees that grow along the rivers.


## Numbers 24:7 (id: 1004024007)

7Your water buckets will always be full. The seeds that you plant will always have plenty of water to make them grow. The Israelites’ king will be greater than King Agag. The kingdom that he rules will be honored.


## Numbers 24:8 (id: 1004024008)

8God brought them out of Egypt, leading them along with his great power that is like a wild ox. God devastates all the nations that oppose him. He breaks all those people’s bones into pieces, and shoots them with his arrows.


## Numbers 24:9 (id: 1004024009)

9The Israelites are like lions that crouch and lie down, ready to spring on their prey, like lionesses that are resting. No one would dare to arouse them! God will bless everyone who blesses you Israelites,


## Numbers 24:10 (id: 1004024010)

10Then King Balak was extremely angry with Balaam. He showed with his hands that he was very angry, and he shouted, saying, “I summoned you here to curse my enemies! Instead, you have blessed them three times!


## Numbers 24:11 (id: 1004024011)

11So now, get out of here! Go back home! I said that I would pay you a lot of money if you cursed them, but Yahweh has prevented you from getting any pay!”


## Numbers 24:12 (id: 1004024012)

12Balaam said to Balak, “Do you not remember what I told the messengers that you sent to me? I said,


## Numbers 24:13 (id: 1004024013)

13‘Even if Balak would give me a palace filled with silver and gold, I would not disobey Yahweh. I cannot do anything bad or anything that is good that he does not approve of.’ And I told you that I could say only what Yahweh says to me.


## Numbers 24:14 (id: 1004024014)

14So yes, I will return to my people, but first, allow me to tell you what will happen to you Moab people in the future.”


## Numbers 24:15 (id: 1004024015)

15Then Balaam said this to Balak: “I, Balaam, son of Beor, am again giving a prophecy. This prophecy that I speak is again as a man who sees what will happen in the future clearly speaks.


## Numbers 24:16 (id: 1004024016)

16I hear a message from God; I know things that God, who lives in heaven, has revealed to me. I see a vision from the one who is all\-powerful. My eyes are open as I prostrate myself in front of him.


## Numbers 24:17 (id: 1004024017)

17The things that I see in the vision are not going to happen now. I see things that God will cause to happen in the future. A man who is a descendant of Jacob will appear like a star; a king who holds a scepter will be one of the Israelite people. He will crush the heads of you people of Moab; he will wipe out the descendants of Seth.


## Numbers 24:18 (id: 1004024018)

18The Israelites will occupy Edom, and they will conquer their enemies who live near Mount Seir. The Israelite people will be victorious.


## Numbers 24:19 (id: 1004024019)

19A ruler will come who is a descendant of Jacob. He will get rid of the people who still live in the city where Balaam first met Balak.”


## Numbers 24:20 (id: 1004024020)

20Then Balaam looked out over where the Amalek people group lived, and he prophesied this, “The Amalek people group were the greatest nation, but they will be wiped out.”


## Numbers 24:21 (id: 1004024021)

21Then he looked out over the area where the Kenite people group lived, and he prophesied this, “You think that the place where you live is secure like a nest that is made in the cliffs,


## Numbers 24:22 (id: 1004024022)

22but you will be wiped out when the army of Assyria conquers you.”


## Numbers 24:23 (id: 1004024023)

23Balaam ended his prophecies by saying, “Also, who can survive when God does all these things?


## Numbers 24:24 (id: 1004024024)

24Ships will come from the Island of Cyprus , and the men in those ships will defeat the armies of Assyria and Eber. But God will get rid of those men, too.”


## Numbers 24:25 (id: 1004024025)

25Then Balaam and Balak returned to their homes.


## Numbers 25:1 (id: 1004025001)

1While the Israelites were camped at a place called Acacia Grove, some of the men became unfaithful to God by sleeping with some of the women of the Moab people group who lived in that area.


## Numbers 25:2 (id: 1004025002)

2Then those women invited the men to come when the sacrifices were being offered to their gods. The Israelite men accepted. They went to the feasts with the women and worshiped the gods of the Moab people group.


## Numbers 25:3 (id: 1004025003)

3By doing that, the Israelite people joined the women in worshiping the god Baal who the Moab people group thought lived on Mount Peor. That caused Yahweh to become very angry with his people, and he sent a severe plague on many of the Israelite people.


## Numbers 25:4 (id: 1004025004)

4Yahweh said this to Moses: “Seize all the leaders of those who are doing this and execute them while I am watching. Do that in the daytime. After you do that, I will no longer be angry with the Israelite people.”


## Numbers 25:5 (id: 1004025005)

5So Moses said to the other Israelite leaders, “Each of you must execute your men who have joined others in worshiping Baal.”


## Numbers 25:6 (id: 1004025006)

6But later, while many people were crying at the entrance of the sacred tent, one of the Israelite men brought a woman from the Midian people group into his tent and started to sleep with her. Moses and all the people heard of it.


## Numbers 25:7 (id: 1004025007)

7When Phinehas, who was a grandson of Aaron, heard this he rose up from among the community, grabbed a spear.


## Numbers 25:8 (id: 1004025008)

8Then he rushed into the man’s tent. He thrust the spear completely through the man’s body and into the woman’s belly and killed both of them. When he did that, the plague that had started to strike the Israelites stopped.


## Numbers 25:9 (id: 1004025009)

9But twenty\-four thousand people had already died from that plague.


## Numbers 25:10 (id: 1004025010)

10Then Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 25:11 (id: 1004025011)

11“Phinehas has caused me to stop being angry with the Israelite people, by being as eager as I am to stop this sinful behavior. I was ready to get rid of all the Israelite people because I was extremely angry, but Phinehas has prevented me from doing that.


## Numbers 25:12 (id: 1004025012)

12Now tell him that I am making a special peace agreement with him.


## Numbers 25:13 (id: 1004025013)

13In this agreement, I am promising to give to him and to his descendants the right to be priests. I am doing this because he showed that he was very eager to honor me, his God, by stopping this sinful behavior. He has satisfied my holy righteousness against the sinfulness of Israel by causing me to forgive them for their sin.”


## Numbers 25:14 (id: 1004025014)

14The Israelite man who was killed with the woman of the Moab people group was named Zimri son of Salu, who was the leader of a family from the tribe of Simeon.


## Numbers 25:15 (id: 1004025015)

15The woman’s name was Kozbi. She was the daughter of Zur, who was the leader of one of the clans of the Midian people group.


## Numbers 25:16 (id: 1004025016)

16Then Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 25:17 (id: 1004025017)

17“Take your men and attack the Midian people group and kill them.


## Numbers 25:18 (id: 1004025018)

18They have become your enemies, because they tricked you Israelite people and induced many of you to worship Baal, and because one of your men slept with Kozbi, who was the daughter of a leader of the Midian people group. She was killed at the time the plague started because of the people who sinned at Mount Peor.”


## Numbers 26:1 (id: 1004026001)

1After the plague ended, Yahweh said to Eleazar and Moses,


## Numbers 26:2 (id: 1004026002)

2“Count all the people of Israel again. Write down the names of all the men who are at least 20 years old who are able to fight in battles, along with their family names.”


## Numbers 26:3 (id: 1004026003)

3So while the Israelites were on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho, Eleazar and Moses told this to the Israelite leaders,


## Numbers 26:4 (id: 1004026004)

4“Write down the names of all the Israelite men who are at least 20 years old, as Yahweh has commanded us.” So they did that, and this is a record of all the descendants of Jacob who came out of Egypt who were still alive.


## Numbers 26:5 (id: 1004026005)

5These are the families who descended from Reuben, Jacob’s oldest son: the Hanokite family descended from his son Hanok; the Palluite family descended from his son Pallu;


## Numbers 26:6 (id: 1004026006)

6the Hezronite family descended from his son Hezron; {and} the Karmite family descended from his son Karmi.


## Numbers 26:7 (id: 1004026007)

7The Israelite leaders counted 43,730 men from the families that descended from Reuben


## Numbers 26:8 (id: 1004026008)

8Pallu’s son was Eliab


## Numbers 26:9 (id: 1004026009)

9and his grandsons were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram were the leaders who joined with Korah to conspire against Aaron and Moses and rebelled against Yahweh.


## Numbers 26:10 (id: 1004026010)

10But the earth opened up and swallowed them and Korah. Yahweh also sent a fire that burned up 250 men who supported those three men. That was a warning to all the Israelite people that they should respect and obey the leaders whom Yahweh had appointed.


## Numbers 26:11 (id: 1004026011)

11But all of those who descended from Korah did not die on that day.


## Numbers 26:12 (id: 1004026012)

12These are the descendants of Simeon: the Nemuelite family descended from his son Nemuel; the Jaminite family descended from his son Jamin; the Jakinite family descended from his son Jakin;


## Numbers 26:13 (id: 1004026013)

53“Divide Canaan land among the tribes. Distribute the land according to the number of people in each tribe that are on your lists.


## Numbers 26:54 (id: 1004026054)

54Yahweh will give to each family an amount of land in proportion to how many people are in it. Families with many people will receive more land than families with less people.


## Numbers 26:55 (id: 1004026055)

55Throw lots to determine which families receive each area of land. Families will inherit land according to which tribe they descended from.


## Numbers 26:56 (id: 1004026056)

56The result of throwing lots will determine the area of land that each family receives. Allot the land between the families with many people and those with few people.”

## Numbers 26:63 (id: 1004026063)

63Those were the men whom Eleazar and Moses said should be counted. They counted the Israelite people on the plains of Moab, on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho.


## Numbers 26:64 (id: 1004026064)

64None of the men whom they counted were on the lists that were made by Aaron and Moses when the Israelites were in the wilderness of Sinai.


## Numbers 26:65 (id: 1004026065)

65They were told what Yahweh had said. He said, “They will all die in this desert,” and that is what happened. The only ones who were still alive were Jephunneh’s son Caleb and Nun’s son Joshua.


## Numbers 27:1 (id: 1004027001)

1One day the five daughters of Zelophehad came to Moses. They were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah, and Tirzah.


## Numbers 27:2 (id: 1004027002)

2They came to the entrance of the sacred tent and stood in front of Eleazar, Moses, the tribal leaders, and many other Israelite people.


## Numbers 27:3 (id: 1004027003)

3They said, “Our father died during the time that we were in the desert, and he did not have any sons. But he was not among those who supported Korah, who rebelled against Yahweh, and he died because of his own sin. He did not have any sons.


## Numbers 27:4 (id: 1004027004)

4Why should the name of his clan disappear because our father had no sons? So give us some land like our father’s relatives will be getting!”


## Numbers 27:5 (id: 1004027005)

5So Moses asked Yahweh what to do about their case.


## Numbers 27:6 (id: 1004027006)

6And Yahweh replied,


## Numbers 27:7 (id: 1004027007)

7“What the daughters of Zelophehad are requesting is right. You must give them some land, just as you are giving to their father’s relatives. Give to each of them some of the land that would have been given to their brothers if they had any.


## Numbers 27:8 (id: 1004027008)

8Also tell this to the Israelite people: ‘If a man who has no sons dies, give the things that his sons would have inherited to his daughters.


## Numbers 27:9 (id: 1004027009)

9If the man has no sons or daughters, give to his brothers the things that his sons and daughters would have inherited.


## Numbers 27:10 (id: 1004027010)

10If the man had no brothers, give to his father’s brothers the things that his sons or daughters or brothers would have inherited.


## Numbers 27:11 (id: 1004027011)

11If the man’s father has no brothers, give to his closest relative the things that the others would have inherited.’ That will be a rule for the Israelite people, because I am giving this as a command to you, Moses, to tell them.”


## Numbers 27:12 (id: 1004027012)

12One day, Yahweh said to Moses, “Climb to the top of the Abarim mountains east of the Jordan River. Then look out over the land that I am giving to the Israelite people.


## Numbers 27:13 (id: 1004027013)

13After you have seen it, you will die just like your older brother Aaron did.


## Numbers 27:14 (id: 1004027014)

14The reason that you will die and not enter that land is that you both disobeyed my instructions in the wilderness of Zin. When the Israelite people rebelled against me there at Meribah, near Kadesh, I told you to speak to the rock to cause water to flow out of it. But because you struck the rock instead of speaking to it, you did not show the people my holy power.”


## Numbers 27:15 (id: 1004027015)

15Then Moses said this to Yahweh,


## Numbers 27:16 (id: 1004027016)

16“Yahweh, you are the God who directs the spirits of all people. So please appoint a new leader for the Israelite people.


## Numbers 27:17 (id: 1004027017)

17Appoint someone who will lead your people when they go to fight a battle, so that they will not just wander around like sheep that do not have a shepherd.”


## Numbers 27:18 (id: 1004027018)

18Yahweh replied, “Get Joshua son of Nun, who has my Spirit within him. Lay your hands on him to appoint him.


## Numbers 27:19 (id: 1004027019)

19Cause him to stand in front of Eleazar the priest, as all the people are watching, and commission him to be the new leader of the Israelite people.


## Numbers 27:20 (id: 1004027020)

20Give to him some of the authority that you now have, in order that all the Israelite people will know that they must obey him.


## Numbers 27:21 (id: 1004027021)

21When you all need me to guide you, Joshua will stand in front of Eleazar. Then by casting lots Eleazar will determine what they should do. At Joshua’s command all people of Israel will mobilize themselves together.”


## Numbers 27:22 (id: 1004027022)

22So Moses did what Yahweh commanded. He presented Joshua to Eleazar and to all the Israelite people.


## Numbers 27:23 (id: 1004027023)

23Moses laid his hands on him and commissioned him to do the work that Yahweh told Moses to tell him to do.


## Numbers 28:1 (id: 1004028001)

1Yahweh said this to Moses,


## Numbers 28:2 (id: 1004028002)

2“Tell this to the Israelite people, ‘Bring to me the offerings that will be burned on the altar. When they are burned, the smell will be very pleasing to me. And tell them that they must bring them at the proper time.


## Numbers 28:3 (id: 1004028003)

3Tell them that what they must bring to me each day are two male lambs that are one year old. They must have no defects. They must be completely burned on the altar.


## Numbers 28:4 (id: 1004028004)

## Numbers 28:8 (id: 1004028008)

Those are in addition to the offerings that you give to me because you promised to do something, and other special offerings that you want to give to me.”


## Numbers 29:40 (id: 1004029040)

40Then Moses told to the Israelite people all the things that Yahweh had commanded him.


## Numbers 30:1 (id: 1004030001)

1Moses spoke with the leaders of the Israelite tribes. He told them these commands that Yahweh had given to him:


## Numbers 30:2 (id: 1004030002)

2“If a man solemnly promises Yahweh that he will do something, he must do what he promised.


## Numbers 30:3 (id: 1004030003)

3If a young woman who is still living with her parents solemnly promises to Yahweh to do something,


## Numbers 30:4 (id: 1004030004)

4and if her father hears about what she promised, and if he does not say anything to her, she must do what she promised.


## Numbers 30:5 (id: 1004030005)

5But if her father hears about what she promised and does not allow her to do that, then she does not need to do what she promised. Yahweh will forgive her for not doing what she promised.


## Numbers 30:6 (id: 1004030006)

6If a woman promises Yahweh that she will do something, but then she gets married,


## Numbers 30:7 (id: 1004030007)

7If she marries a husband while under the vows, or she makes rash utterances by which she obligates herself, they will stand.


## Numbers 30:8 (id: 1004030008)

8But if her husband stops her on the day that he hears about it, then he cancels the vow that she has made, the rash talk of her lips with which she has bound herself. Yahweh will release her.


## Numbers 30:9 (id: 1004030009)

9If a widow or a woman who has been divorced makes a promise, she must do what she promised.


## Numbers 30:10 (id: 1004030010)

10If a woman who is married promises to do something,


## Numbers 30:11 (id: 1004030011)

11and if her husband hears about it but does not object, she must do what she promised.


## Numbers 30:12 (id: 1004030012)

12But if he hears about it and does not allow her to do that, she does not need to do what she promised, and Yahweh will forgive her for not doing it.


## Numbers 30:13 (id: 1004030013)

13A woman’s husband may require her to do what she has promised, or he may not allow her to do what she has promised.


## Numbers 30:14 (id: 1004030014)

14If he does not object for several days after he hears about it, she must do what she promised.


## Numbers 30:15 (id: 1004030015)

15But if he waits a long time after she has promised to do something and then he tells her that he will not permit her to do it, if she does not do what she promised, she will not be punished. Her husband is the one whom Yahweh will punish.”


## Numbers 30:16 (id: 1004030016)

16Those are the rules that Yahweh gave to Moses for husbands and wives, and for young women who are still living with their parents.


## Numbers 31:1 (id: 1004031001)

1Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,


## Numbers 31:2 (id: 1004031002)

2“Tell the Israelite people that they should pay back the Midian people group for what they did to you. After that happens, you will die.”


## Numbers 31:3 (id: 1004031003)

3So Moses said to the people, “Get some men prepared for battle. Yahweh will enable them to pay back the Midian people group for what they did to us.


## Numbers 31:4 (id: 1004031004)

4Select a thousand men from each tribe to fight.”


## Numbers 31:5 (id: 1004031005)

5So twelve thousand men prepared for fighting in the battle, one thousand from each tribe.


## Numbers 31:6 (id: 1004031006)

6When Moses sent them to the battle, Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, went with them. He took with him some of the things from the sacred tent and the trumpets that would be blown to give the signal to start the battle.


## Numbers 31:7 (id: 1004031007)

7The Israelite men fought the soldiers from the Midian people group, as Yahweh had told Moses to tell them to do, and they killed every man from the Midian people group.


## Numbers 31:8 (id: 1004031008)

8Among those whom they killed were the five kings of the Midian people group—Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam with a sword son of Beor.


## Numbers 31:9 (id: 1004031009)

9They captured all the women and children of the Midian people group and took away their cattle, their flocks of sheep, and herds of goats, and all their other possessions.


## Numbers 31:10 (id: 1004031010)

10Then they burned down all the houses in the towns and villages where the people of the Midian people group lived.


## Numbers 31:11 (id: 1004031011)

11But they took home with them all the women and children and animals and possessions.


## Numbers 31:12 (id: 1004031012)

12They brought all these to Eleazer and Moses, and to the rest of the Israelite people who were at their camp on the plains of Moab, near the Jordan River, across from Jericho.


## Numbers 31:13 (id: 1004031013)

13Eleazar and all the leaders of the people and Moses went outside the camp to greet them.


## Numbers 31:14 (id: 1004031014)

14But Moses was angry with some of the men who had returned from the battle. He was angry with the army officers, those men who were commanders over thousands of men and those who were commanders over hundreds of men.


## Numbers 31:15 (id: 1004031015)

15He asked them, “Why did you allow the women to live?


## Numbers 31:16 (id: 1004031016)

16They are the ones who did what Balaam suggested and urged our people to worship Baal instead of Yahweh. As a result, Yahweh caused a plague to strike his people while they were at Peor.


## Numbers 31:17 (id: 1004031017)

17So, now you must kill all the boys of the Midian people group, and also kill all the women who have slept with any man.


## Numbers 31:18 (id: 1004031018)

18Spare only the girls who are virgins. You can keep them to be your wives or your slaves.


## Numbers 31:19 (id: 1004031019)

19All of you who have killed someone or touched the corpse of someone who was killed in the battle must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and on the seventh day, you must perform the ritual to enable you to become acceptable to God again. You and your prisoners.


## Numbers 31:20 (id: 1004031020)

20You must also wash your clothes and anything that you took to the battle that is made of leather or goat’s hair or wood.”


## Numbers 31:21 (id: 1004031021)

21Then Eleazar said to the soldiers who had returned from the battle, “This is what Yahweh has instructed Moses.


## Numbers 31:22 (id: 1004031022)

22You must put into a fire any gold or silver or bronze or iron or tin or lead things that you brought back from the battle.


## Numbers 31:23 (id: 1004031023)

23Put everything that will not burn into the fire, and then they will be acceptable for you to use. But also sprinkle those things with the water that causes things and people to become acceptable to God. The things that would burn if you put them in a fire, sprinkle them with that water.


## Numbers 31:24 (id: 1004031024)

24On the seventh day, wash your clothes, and then you will become acceptable to God again. After you do that, you may return to the camp.”


## Numbers 31:25 (id: 1004031025)

25Yahweh also said to Moses,


## Numbers 31:26 (id: 1004031026)

26“Tell Eleazar and the leaders of the family groups that they must write down a list of all the goods, the women, and the animals that were captured in the battle.


## Numbers 31:27 (id: 1004031027)

27Then tell Eleazar and the leaders of the family groups that they must divide all those things between the men who fought in the battle and the rest of the people.


## Numbers 31:28 (id: 1004031028)

28From the men who fought in the battle, take one from every five hundred people and from every five hundred cattle and donkeys and sheep, to be a tax for me.


## Numbers 31:29 (id: 1004031029)

29Take these things to Eleazar to be my share as the offering presented to me.


## Numbers 31:30 (id: 1004031030)

30And from the other things, take one item from every fifty. That includes people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals. Give those things to the descendants of Levi who take care of my sacred tent.”


## Numbers 31:31 (id: 1004031031)

31So Eleazar and Moses did what Yahweh commanded.


## Numbers 31:32 (id: 1004031032)

32This is what remained from everything that the soldiers had looted: 675,000 sheep,


## Numbers 31:33 (id: 1004031033)

3372,000 cattle,


## Numbers 31:34 (id: 1004031034)

3461,000 donkeys,


## Numbers 31:35 (id: 1004031035)

35and 32,000 virgin girls.


## Numbers 31:36 (id: 1004031036)

36The men who fought in the battle took 337, 000 sheep from the battle,


## Numbers 31:37 (id: 1004031037)

37and they gave 675 of them to Yahweh.


## Numbers 31:38 (id: 1004031038)

38They took thirty\-six thousand cattle and gave 72 of them to Yahweh.


## Numbers 31:39 (id: 1004031039)

39They took 30, 500 donkeys, and they gave 61 of them to Yahweh.


## Numbers 31:40 (id: 1004031040)

40They took sixteen thousand virgins, and they gave 32 of them to Yahweh.


## Numbers 31:41 (id: 1004031041)

41Moses gave to Eleazar all the animals that had been presented to Yahweh, as Yahweh had commanded.


## Numbers 31:42 (id: 1004031042)

42Moses separated what those who had fought in the battle received


## Numbers 31:43 (id: 1004031043)

43from what the other people received. The people received 337,500 sheep,


## Numbers 31:44 (id: 1004031044)

4436,000 cattle,


## Numbers 31:45 (id: 1004031045)

4530,500 donkeys,


## Numbers 31:46 (id: 1004031046)

46and 16,000 virgin girls.


## Numbers 31:47 (id: 1004031047)

47From what the people received, Moses took one from every fifty items and gave them to Yahweh. That included animals and people. As Yahweh commanded, Moses gave them all to the descendants of Levi who took care of the sacred tent.


## Numbers 31:48 (id: 1004031048)

48Then the army officers, those who were commanders over thousands of men and those who were commanders over hundreds of men, they came to Moses.


## Numbers 31:49 (id: 1004031049)

49They said, “We, who are your servants, have counted the soldiers whom we command, and we found that none of them is missing.


## Numbers 31:50 (id: 1004031050)

50So to thank Yahweh for that, we have brought to him a gift of the gold items that we found after the battle, gold arm bands and bracelets and rings, earrings and necklaces. We hope that this will atone for our sins.”


## Numbers 31:51 (id: 1004031051)

51So Eleazar and Moses accepted the gold items that they brought.


## Numbers 31:52 (id: 1004031052)

52The total of the offering they presented weighed about one hundred and ninety one kilograms.


## Numbers 31:53 (id: 1004031053)

53Each soldier had taken these things for himself.


## Numbers 31:54 (id: 1004031054)

54Eleazar and Moses accepted these gold items from these commanders and put them in the sacred tent to remind the Israelite people about how Yahweh had helped them defeat the Midian people group.


## Numbers 32:1 (id: 1004032001)

1The people of the tribes of Reuben and Gad had a lot of livestock. They saw that the land near the city of Jazer and the region of Gilead east of the Jordan River had good grass for the animals to graze on.


## Numbers 32:2 (id: 1004032002)

2So their leaders came to Eleazar and the leaders of the people and Moses. They said,


## Numbers 32:3 (id: 1004032003)

3“This is a list of places we have surveyed: Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon.


## Numbers 32:4 (id: 1004032004)

4Yahweh has enabled us Israelites to capture some land that is very good for animals to graze on—the land near the towns of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon.


## Numbers 32:5 (id: 1004032005)

5If it pleases you, we would like this land to be ours, instead of land on the other side of the Jordan River.”


## Numbers 32:6 (id: 1004032006)

6Moses replied to the leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben, “It is not right for your fellow Israelites to go to fight in wars and you stay here!


## Numbers 32:7 (id: 1004032007)

7If you do that, you will cause the other Israelites to be discouraged, with the result that they will not cross the Jordan River to the land that Yahweh is giving to them.


## Numbers 32:8 (id: 1004032008)

8Our ancestors did the same kind of thing. I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see what the land of Canaan was like.


## Numbers 32:9 (id: 1004032009)

9They went as far as Eshcol Valley, but when they saw the huge people in the land, they returned and caused the Israelite people to be discouraged saying, ‘We should not try to enter the land that Yahweh said that he is giving to us.’


## Numbers 32:10 (id: 1004032010)

10So Yahweh became very angry with them, and he solemnly declared this,


## Numbers 32:11 (id: 1004032011)

11(11\-12\) ‘From all the people who came out of Egypt, the only ones who are at least twenty years old who will see the land that I promised to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are Jephunneh’s son Caleb and Nun’s son Joshua, because they trusted me completely. None of the other people who came out of Egypt will even see that land, because they have not completely believed in my power.’


## Numbers 32:13 (id: 1004032013)

13So Yahweh was angry with the Israelite people, and as a result he has caused us to wander in this desert for forty years. Finally, all the people who had sinned against Yahweh by refusing to trust him died, one by one.


## Numbers 32:14 (id: 1004032014)

14And you are acting like your ancestors did! You sinful Israelite people are going to cause Yahweh to be more angry with you than he was with our ancestors!


## Numbers 32:15 (id: 1004032015)

15If you stop trusting him, he will cause you and all your fellow Israelites to stay longer in the desert, and he will get rid of all of you!”


## Numbers 32:16 (id: 1004032016)

16Then the leaders of the tribes of Reuben and Gad said to Moses, “First we will build pens for our animals and build cities for our families here.


## Numbers 32:17 (id: 1004032017)

17Then our families will live in strong cities with walls around them, and they will be safe from the people who live in this land. Then we will get ready to fight battles. We will help the other Israelites to get land on the other side of the river.


## Numbers 32:18 (id: 1004032018)

18We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received some land.


## Numbers 32:19 (id: 1004032019)

19We will not take any land on the west side of the Jordan River, because our land will be here on the east side.”


## Numbers 32:20 (id: 1004032020)

20So Moses told them, “I will tell you what you must do. You must get ready to fight battles for Yahweh.


## Numbers 32:21 (id: 1004032021)

21You must cross the Jordan River carrying your weapons.


## Numbers 32:22 (id: 1004032022)

22After Yahweh helps us to take that land from the people who live there, you will be permitted to return to your homes. You will have done what you have promised Yahweh and the Israelite people that you would do, and you may keep this land to be your own, given to you by Yahweh.


## Numbers 32:23 (id: 1004032023)

23But if you do not do these things, you will be sinning against Yahweh, and he will punish you for that sin.


## Numbers 32:24 (id: 1004032024)

24Now you can build cities for your families and pens for your animals, but after doing that, you must do what you have promised.”


## Numbers 32:25 (id: 1004032025)

25The leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, “We will do what you have asked us to do, because you are our leader.


## Numbers 32:26 (id: 1004032026)

26Our wives and children and our cattle and sheep and goats will stay here in the cities of the Gilead area,


## Numbers 32:27 (id: 1004032027)

27but we will prepare to go to battle. We will take our weapons and go across the Jordan River and fight for Yahweh, just as you, our leader, have said.”


## Numbers 32:28 (id: 1004032028)

28So Moses gave instructions about them to Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of the Israelite tribes.


## Numbers 32:29 (id: 1004032029)

29Moses said to them, “If the men from the tribes of Gad and Reuben prepare for battle and cross the Jordan River with you, in order to do what Yahweh desires and help you to take that land, give them the Gilead area to belong to them.


## Numbers 32:30 (id: 1004032030)

30But if they do not take their weapons and go with you prepared to fight, they will not receive this land. They will need to accept some land in Canaan, like the rest of you will do.”


## Numbers 32:31 (id: 1004032031)

31The leaders of the tribes of Gad and Reuben replied, “We will do what you have said and what Yahweh has said.


## Numbers 32:32 (id: 1004032032)

32We will cross the river into Canaan land, and we will do what Yahweh desires and be prepared for battle. But our land will be here on the east side of the Jordan River.”


## Numbers 32:33 (id: 1004032033)

33So Moses agreed to give that land to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and to half of the tribe of Joseph’s son Manasseh. That land was previously the land where Sihon, the king of the Amor people group, ruled, and the land where Og, the king of Bashan region, ruled, including its cities and surrounding land.


## Numbers 32:34 (id: 1004032034)

34The people of the tribe of Gad rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,


## Numbers 32:35 (id: 1004032035)

35Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,


## Numbers 32:36 (id: 1004032036)

36Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran cities. Those were cities with strong walls around them. And they also built pens for their sheep.


## Numbers 32:37 (id: 1004032037)

37The people of the tribe of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,


## Numbers 32:38 (id: 1004032038)

38Nebo, Baal Meon, and Sibmah cities. When they rebuilt Nebo and Baal Meon, they gave new names to those cities.


## Numbers 32:39 (id: 1004032039)

39The descendants of Manasseh’s son Makir went to the region of Gilead and took it away from the Amor people group.


## Numbers 32:40 (id: 1004032040)

40So Moses gave Gilead to the family of Makir, and they started to live there.


## Numbers 32:41 (id: 1004032041)

41Jair, who was also a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured the small towns in that region, and he named them the Towns of Jair.


## Numbers 32:42 (id: 1004032042)

42A man named Nobah went and captured the city of Kenath and the nearby towns, and then he used his own name to be the new name of that area.


## Numbers 33:1 (id: 1004033001)

1Here is a list of the places where the Israelites went as Aaron and Moses led them after they left Egypt.


## Numbers 33:2 (id: 1004033002)

2Yahweh commanded Moses to write down the names of the places where they went.


## Numbers 33:3 (id: 1004033003)

3On the fifteenth day of the first month of the year, the day after they celebrated the Passover, they left the city of Rameses in Egypt and marched boldly while the Egyptian army was coming behind them.


## Numbers 33:4 (id: 1004033004)

4As they left, the people of Egypt were still burying the bodies of their firstborn sons. By killing them, Yahweh showed that the gods that the people of Egypt worshiped were false gods.


## Numbers 33:5 (id: 1004033005)

5After leaving Rameses, they first went to Succoth and set up their tents there.


## Numbers 33:6 (id: 1004033006)

6Then they left Succoth and went to Etham, at the edge of the desert, and set up their tents there.


## Numbers 33:7 (id: 1004033007)

7Then they left Etham and returned to Pi Hahiroth, to the east of Baal Zephon, and set up their tents near Migdol.


## Numbers 33:8 (id: 1004033008)

8Then they left Pi Hahiroth and walked through the Sea of Reeds and continued three days into the Etham Desert, and set their tents at Marah.


## Numbers 33:9 (id: 1004033009)

9Then they left Marah and went to Elim. There were twelve springs and seventy palm trees there. They set up their tents there.


## Numbers 33:10 (id: 1004033010)

10Then they left Elim and went to the area near the Sea of Reeds and set up their tents there.


## Numbers 33:11 (id: 1004033011)

11Then they left the Sea of Reeds and went near the wilderness of Sinai and set up their tents there.


## Numbers 33:12 (id: 1004033012)

12Then they left the wilderness of Sinai and went to Dophkah and set up their tents there.


## Numbers 33:13 (id: 1004033013)

13Then they left Dophkah and went to Alush and set up their tents there.


## Numbers 33:14 (id: 1004033014)

39Aaron was 123 years old when he died.


## Numbers 33:40 (id: 1004033040)

40That was when the king of the city of Arad heard that the Israelites were coming. Arad was in the southern wilderness in the land of Canaan, where the Canaan people group lived.


## Numbers 33:41 (id: 1004033041)

49They set up their tents there on the plains of Moab. Their tents stretched for several kilometers from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim.


## Numbers 33:50 (id: 1004033050)

50While we were there on the plains of Moab near the Jordan River, across from Jericho, Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,


## Numbers 33:51 (id: 1004033051)

51“Tell this to the Israelite people, ‘When you cross the Jordan River and enter the region of Canaan,


## Numbers 33:52 (id: 1004033052)

52you must force all the people who live there to leave. Destroy all their carved figures and all cast figures made of metal. Wreck all the places where they worship their idols.


## Numbers 33:53 (id: 1004033053)

53Take their land from them and start to live there, because I have given their land to you for you to own.


## Numbers 33:54 (id: 1004033054)

54Divide up the land by casting lots to decide which group will get which area. Give the larger areas to the groups that have more people, and give the smaller areas to the groups that have fewer people. Each tribe will receive its own land.


## Numbers 33:55 (id: 1004033055)

55If you do not force the people who live there to leave, they will cause you to have much trouble. They will be like sharp hooks in your eyes, and like thorns in your sides. And they will bring trouble to you, in that land where you will be living.


## Numbers 33:56 (id: 1004033056)

56And then I will punish you, as I had planned to punish them.’”


## Numbers 34:1 (id: 1004034001)

1Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 34:2 (id: 1004034002)

2“Tell this to the Israelite people, ‘You will soon enter Canaan land, and it will become yours. The following will be the borders of the land.


## Numbers 34:3 (id: 1004034003)

3On the south you will receive part of the wilderness of Zin, near the border of the region of Edom. On the east side, the border will start at the south end of the Dead Sea.


## Numbers 34:4 (id: 1004034004)

4It will extend to a little south of the Scorpion Pass, and extend west through the wilderness of Sin and south of Kadesh Barnea. From there it will extend to Hazar Addar and from there to Azmon.


## Numbers 34:5 (id: 1004034005)

5From Azmon it will extend west to the dry riverbed at the border of Egypt and then to the Mediterranean Sea.


## Numbers 34:6 (id: 1004034006)

6The border on the west will be the Mediterranean Sea.


## Numbers 34:7 (id: 1004034007)

7The border on the north will start from the Mediterranean Sea and extend west to Mount Hor.


## Numbers 34:8 (id: 1004034008)

8From there it will extend to Lebo Hamath and then to Zedad.


## Numbers 34:9 (id: 1004034009)

9From there the border will extend to Ziphron, and it will end at Hazar Enan.


## Numbers 34:10 (id: 1004034010)

10The border on the east will start at Hazar Enan and extend south to Shepham.


## Numbers 34:11 (id: 1004034011)

11From there it will extend east of Ain to Riblah and then along the hills that are east of Galilee Lake.


## Numbers 34:12 (id: 1004034012)

12Then the border will extend south along the Jordan River and end at the Dead Sea. Those will be the borders around your country.’”


## Numbers 34:13 (id: 1004034013)

13So Moses told all that to the Israelite people. Then he said to them, “That is the land that you will receive. You must cast lots to decide which area will go to each of the nine and a half tribes, because Yahweh has commanded that it should be divided among them.


## Numbers 34:14 (id: 1004034014)

14The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh have already received the land in which they will live.


## Numbers 34:15 (id: 1004034015)

15They have received land on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho.”


## Numbers 34:16 (id: 1004034016)

16Then Yahweh said to Moses,


## Numbers 34:17 (id: 1004034017)

17“These are the men who will divide the land. First, Eleazar and Joshua,


## Numbers 34:18 (id: 1004034018)

18but other leaders from each of the twelve tribes will help them divide the land.


## Numbers 34:19 (id: 1004034019)

19From the tribe of Judah, appoint Jephunneh’s son Caleb.


## Numbers 34:20 (id: 1004034020)

20From the tribe of Simeon appoint Ammihud’s son Shemuel.


## Numbers 34:21 (id: 1004034021)

21From the tribe of Benjamin appoint Kislon’s son Elidad.


## Numbers 34:22 (id: 1004034022)

22From the tribe of Dan appoint Jogli’s son Bukki.


## Numbers 34:23 (id: 1004034023)

23From the tribe of Manasseh appoint Ephod’s son Hanniel.


## Numbers 34:24 (id: 1004034024)

24From the tribe of Ephraim appoint Shiphtan’s son Kemuel.


## Numbers 34:25 (id: 1004034025)

25From the tribe of Zebulun appoint Parnak’s son Elizaphan.


## Numbers 34:26 (id: 1004034026)

26From the tribe of Issachar appoint Azzan’s son Paltiel.


## Numbers 34:27 (id: 1004034027)

27From the tribe of Asher appoint Shelomi’s son Ahihud.


## Numbers 34:28 (id: 1004034028)

28From the tribe of Naphtali appoint Ammihud’s son Pedahel.”


## Numbers 34:29 (id: 1004034029)

29Yahweh commanded that all those were the men who should divide the region of Canaan among the Israelite people.


## Numbers 35:1 (id: 1004035001)

1Yahweh told this to Moses while the Israelites were on the plain in Moab near the Jordan River, across from Jericho,


## Numbers 35:2 (id: 1004035002)

2“Tell the Israelite people that from the land that they will receive, they must give to the descendants of Levi some cities in which they can live. They must also give them some land around these cities.


## Numbers 35:3 (id: 1004035003)

3These cities will be for the descendants of Levi to live in, and around the cities will be land for their cattle and flocks of sheep and goats and other animals.


## Numbers 35:4 (id: 1004035004)

4The land that you give them for their animals must extend out for 457 meters from the walls of the cities.


## Numbers 35:5 (id: 1004035005)

5Also measure 920 meters in each direction out from the walls of each city. That additional land will be land for their animals outside the walls of the cities.


## Numbers 35:6 (id: 1004035006)

6Six of the cities that you give to the descendants of Levi will be cities to which people can run to be safe. If someone accidentally kills someone else, the one who killed that person may run to one of those cities to be safe.


## Numbers 35:7 (id: 1004035007)

7You must also give to the descendants of Levi forty\-two other cities and the land around those cities for their animals.


## Numbers 35:8 (id: 1004035008)

8The Israelite tribes who have the most people must give them more cities than the tribes who have fewer people give. Each tribe must give some of its cities to the descendants of Levi, but the tribes that have more land must give more cities, and the tribes that have fewer cities will give fewer cities.”


## Numbers 35:9 (id: 1004035009)

9Yahweh also said to Moses,


## Numbers 35:10 (id: 1004035010)

10“Tell this to the Israelite people, ‘When you cross the Jordan River and enter the region of Canaan,


## Numbers 35:11 (id: 1004035011)

11you must choose some cities to which people can run to be safe. If someone kills another person, the one who killed that person may run to one of those cities and be safe.


## Numbers 35:12 (id: 1004035012)

12One of the relatives of the person who was killed may think he must avenge his relative’s death by killing the murderer. But in that city, the killer will be safe because the people in that city would kill those relatives if they tried to get revenge there. The man who killed someone accidentally must be put on trial in a court.


## Numbers 35:13 (id: 1004035013)

13You must set apart six cities to be cities to which someone who killed another person accidentally may run and be safe.


## Numbers 35:14 (id: 1004035014)

14There must be three of these cities on the east side of the Jordan River and three on the west side, in the region of Canaan.


## Numbers 35:15 (id: 1004035015)

15Those six cities will be cities where Israelite people may run and be safe, and where foreigners and other people who are living among you can also run and be safe. Any of those people who accidentally kills someone may run to one of these cities and be safe there.


## Numbers 35:16 (id: 1004035016)

16But anyone who killed someone by hitting that person with a metal weapon is a murderer. You must execute all murderers.


## Numbers 35:17 (id: 1004035017)

17And anyone who killed someone by hitting that person with a rock is a murderer. You must execute all murderers.


## Numbers 35:18 (id: 1004035018)

18And anyone who killed someone by hitting that person with a piece of wood is a murderer. You must execute all murderers.


## Numbers 35:19 (id: 1004035019)

19A relative of the person who was murdered must be the one who executes the murderer as soon as he finds him.


## Numbers 35:20 (id: 1004035020)

20If someone shoves another person over a cliff or throws something at another person


## Numbers 35:21 (id: 1004035021)

21or hits that person with his hand and causes that person to die, if he did it because he hated that person, then you must consider that he is a murderer, and must be executed. A relative of the person who was killed must be the one who executes the murderer as soon as he finds him.


## Numbers 35:22 (id: 1004035022)

22But someone might accidentally shove someone else, or he might accidentally throw something at another person and hit him, but not because he hates that person.


## Numbers 35:23 (id: 1004035023)

23Or he might drop a rock on someone that he could not see. There is a law for the one who does that did not plan to hurt anyone and did not hate the person who was killed.


## Numbers 35:24 (id: 1004035024)

24That law is that the people of that city must decide whether the relative of the dead person has the right to get revenge, or whether the one who killed the other person truly did it accidentally.


## Numbers 35:25 (id: 1004035025)

25If they decide that the killer planned to kill the other person, they must not allow him to stay in their city. But if they decide that it was done accidentally, they must protect the killer from being killed by the dead person’s relative. They must send the killer to one of the cities where he will be safe, and allow him to stay there until the high priest dies. After that, the killer may go back to his home, because the dead person’s relative no longer has the right to get revenge.


## Numbers 35:26 (id: 1004035026)

26But while the high priest is still living, the person who is in that safe city must not leave that city.


## Numbers 35:27 (id: 1004035027)

27If he goes outside the city, and if a relative of the dead person finds him, that relative is permitted to kill that person, and people will not consider that the relative is guilty of murder.


## Numbers 35:28 (id: 1004035028)

28The killer must stay in that city where he will be safe until the high priest dies. He will be safe from revenge after that, because the death of the high priest will be considered to be a sacrifice to atone for that murder. After that, the killer may return to his home.


## Numbers 35:29 (id: 1004035029)

29You must always obey these legal proceedings, wherever you live.


## Numbers 35:30 (id: 1004035030)

30If someone is accused of killing another person, the one who is accused may be executed only if there are people who saw him do it. There must be more than one witness. No one is permitted to be executed if there was only one witness.


## Numbers 35:31 (id: 1004035031)

31If there is a murderer who truly should be executed, do not spare his life by accepting a ransom. He must be executed.


## Numbers 35:32 (id: 1004035032)

32If someone has run to a city where he will be safe, do not allow him to give you money in order that you will permit him to return to his home before the high priest dies.


## Numbers 35:33 (id: 1004035033)

33You must execute people who truly murder others. If you did not do that, you would be causing the people who live in the land to become unacceptable to me. Anyone who deliberately kills an innocent person must be executed.


## Numbers 35:34 (id: 1004035034)

34I am Yahweh, and I live among you Israelites, so do not spoil the land by allowing people to murder others without being punished.’”


## Numbers 36:1 (id: 1004036001)

1The family leaders of the clan of Gilead of the tribe of Manasseh went to Moses and the other family leaders of the Israelite people.


## Numbers 36:2 (id: 1004036002)

2They said to Moses, “Yahweh commanded you, our leader, to apportion the land to the Israelite tribes by casting lots to decide which group would get which area. Yahweh also commanded you to give the land that belonged to our fellow Israelite Zelophehad to his daughters.


## Numbers 36:3 (id: 1004036003)

3But if his daughters marry men from the other Israelite tribes, that land will no longer belong to our tribe. People of other tribes will get it. So some of our land will no longer belong to us.


## Numbers 36:4 (id: 1004036004)

4When the year of the celebration of Jubilee comes, when all the land that has been bought by someone is returned to its original owners, the land that belonged to Zelophehad will belong to the tribes of the men that his daughters marry. So some of our land, the land that we received from our fathers, will be taken from us, and we will never own it again.”


## Numbers 36:5 (id: 1004036005)

5Yahweh told Moses what to reply to them, so Moses said this to them, “These men from the tribe of Manasseh are right.


## Numbers 36:6 (id: 1004036006)

6This is what Yahweh is saying to the daughters of Zelophehad, ‘Each of you may marry anyone you want to, but you must marry only someone from your own tribe.’


## Numbers 36:7 (id: 1004036007)

7In that way, the land that belongs to Israelites will not be passed from one tribe to another tribe. Each Israelite will keep the land in the tribe that belonged to his ancestors.


## Numbers 36:8 (id: 1004036008)

8A woman who inherits her father’s land may get married, but she must marry someone from her own tribe. In that way, every Israelite will keep the land that belonged to his ancestors.


## Numbers 36:9 (id: 1004036009)

9The land must not be passed from one tribe to another tribe. Each Israelite tribe must keep the land that it received from its ancestors.”


## Numbers 36:10 (id: 1004036010)

10Zelophehad’s daughters obeyed what Yahweh told Moses.


## Numbers 36:11 (id: 1004036011)

11The five daughters—Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah and Noah—married their cousins, their father’s relatives.


## Numbers 36:12 (id: 1004036012)

12The men whom they married were from the tribe of Manasseh, so their land continued to belong to their father’s family and tribe.


## Numbers 36:13 (id: 1004036013)

13Those were the commands and decrees that Yahweh gave to Moses to tell to the Israelites, while they were on the plains of Moab, close to the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
