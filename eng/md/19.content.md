## Psalms 9:18 (id: 1019009018)

18This all happens because there is a certainly time when God will remember {to take care of} poor people. It is good for oppressed people to expect him to rescue them because he will do it one day.

6He thinks, “Nothing bad can happen to me! As long as I live, nothing will trouble me.”


## Psalms 10:7 (id: 1019010007)

7He constantly curses, lies, and threatens others. He is always talking about harming others and doing wrong.


## Psalms 10:8 (id: 1019010008)

## Psalms 10:9 (id: 1019010009)

13Do not let wicked people curse you, God! Do not let him believe that you do not care about his evil deeds!


## Psalms 10:14 (id: 1019010014)

14Surely you see everything! You pay attention to how wicked people hurt and frustrate other people so that you can punish those wicked people. Unlucky people trust that you will protect them. You help orphans.


## Psalms 10:15 (id: 1019010015)

15Cause people who are always doing very evil things to become powerless! When someone tries to oppress other people may he discover he cannot do it.

16Yahweh reigns eternally! Foreign people no longer occupy his land.


## Psalms 10:17 (id: 1019010017)

17Yahweh, when oppressed people ask you to help, you listen and encourage them. You pay close attention,

4“Yahweh, show me how long I will live. Tell me when I will die. Tell me how many years I will live!


## Psalms 39:5 (id: 1019039005)

5It seems that you have caused me to live only a short time; my lifetime seems nothing to you. The time that all we humans live is as short as a puff of air.


## Psalms 39:6 (id: 1019039006)

6Then we disappear like a shadow does. It seems that all that we do is for nothing. We sometimes get a lot of money, but we do not even know who will get it after we die.


## Psalms 39:7 (id: 1019039007)

7So now, Yahweh, I can expect to receive nothing from anyone else. You are the only one from whom I confidently expect to receive blessings.


## Psalms 39:8 (id: 1019039008)

8Deliver me from the sins that I have committed. Do not allow foolish people to make fun of me.


## Psalms 39:9 (id: 1019039009)

9I did not say anything when you punished me because I knew that you were the one who caused me to suffer.


## Psalms 39:10 (id: 1019039010)

10But now, please stop punishing me! If you do not do that, I am about to die because of how you make me suffer.


## Psalms 39:11 (id: 1019039011)

11When you rebuke someone and punish him for the sin that he has committed, you destroy the things he loves like moths eat away at clothing. Our lives disappear like a puff of air.


## Psalms 39:12 (id: 1019039012)

12Yahweh, listen to me while I pray; pay attention to me while I cry out to you. Help me while I am crying. I am here on the earth for only a short time, like all my ancestors.


## Psalms 39:13 (id: 1019039013)

13Now please allow me to be alone and do not punish me anymore so that I may smile and be happy for a while before I die.”


## Psalms 40:1 (id: 1019040001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director; I waited patiently for Yahweh to help me, and he listened to me when I called out to him.


## Psalms 40:2 (id: 1019040002)

2When I had many troubles, it was as though I was in a deep pit. But he lifted me up out of the mud and slime of that pit; he set my feet on a solid rock and enabled me to walk safely.


## Psalms 40:3 (id: 1019040003)

3He has given me a new song to sing, a song to praise him who is our God. Many people will find out what he has done for me, and they will revere and trust him.


## Psalms 40:4 (id: 1019040004)

4How fortunate are those who trust Yahweh to protect them, those who do not trust in idols or join with those who worship those false gods.


## Psalms 40:5 (id: 1019040005)

5O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things! No one can list all the wonderful things that you have planned for us. If I tried to tell others about all those wonderful things, I would not be able to because there would be too many for me to mention.


## Psalms 40:6 (id: 1019040006)

6Sacrifices and other offerings are not the things that delight you most. But you have enabled me to hear your commands. Animals burned on the altar and other offerings for our sins are not what you require most.


## Psalms 40:7 (id: 1019040007)

7So I said to you, “Yahweh, here I am, to obey the laws that have been written in the scroll, things that you want me to do.”


## Psalms 40:8 (id: 1019040008)

8O my God, I enjoy doing what you desire; I am always thinking about your laws within my inner being.


## Psalms 40:9 (id: 1019040009)

9When all your people were gathered together, I told them about how you do what is right and how you rescue us. Yahweh, you know that I have not refused to tell that to them.


## Psalms 40:10 (id: 1019040010)

10I have not kept within me the news that you always act justly; when many of your people have gathered together to worship you, I have told them that you are faithful to us and save us. I have not concealed that you faithfully love us and act loyally toward us.


## Psalms 40:11 (id: 1019040011)

11Yahweh, do not stop acting mercifully toward me. Because you faithfully love me and are loyal to me, protect me always.


## Psalms 40:12 (id: 1019040012)

12I have many troubles; I cannot count them. I am now suffering the things that happened because I sinned. I can no longer see because of my tears. The sins that I have committed are more than the hairs on my head. I am very discouraged.


## Psalms 40:13 (id: 1019040013)

13O Yahweh, please save me! Come quickly to help me!


## Psalms 40:14 (id: 1019040014)

14Humble those who are happy about my troubles, and cause them to be disgraced. Chase away those who are trying to get rid of me.


## Psalms 40:15 (id: 1019040015)

15I hope that those who make fun of me will be dismayed when you defeat them.


## Psalms 40:16 (id: 1019040016)

16But I hope that all those who go to worship you will be very joyful. I hope that those who love you because you saved them will shout repeatedly, “Yahweh is great!”


## Psalms 40:17 (id: 1019040017)

17As for me, I am poor and needy, but I know that the Lord has not forgotten me. O my God, you are the one who saves and helps me, so please come quickly and help me!


## Psalms 41:1 (id: 1019041001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director; How fortunate are those who provide for the poor; Yahweh will rescue those people when they have troubles.


## Psalms 41:2 (id: 1019041002)

2Yahweh will protect them and allow them to live for a long time. He will enable them to be happy in the land of Israel and will rescue them from their enemies.


## Psalms 41:3 (id: 1019041003)

3When they are sick, Yahweh will strengthen them and will heal them.


## Psalms 41:4 (id: 1019041004)

4When I was sick, I said, “Yahweh, act mercifully toward me and heal me; I know that I am sick because I have sinned against you.”


## Psalms 41:5 (id: 1019041005)

5My enemies say cruel things about me; they say, “How soon will he die, and then everyone will forget about him?”


## Psalms 41:6 (id: 1019041006)

6When my enemies come to me, they pretend to be concerned about me. They eagerly listen to all the bad news about me. Then they go away and tell everyone what is happening to me.


## Psalms 41:7 (id: 1019041007)

7All those who hate me whisper to others about me, and they hope that very bad things will happen to me.


## Psalms 41:8 (id: 1019041008)

8They say, “He will soon die because of his being sick; he will never get up from his bed before he dies.”


## Psalms 41:9 (id: 1019041009)

9Even a very close friend, whom I trusted very much, who often ate with me, has betrayed me.


## Psalms 41:10 (id: 1019041010)

10But Yahweh, act mercifully to me, and enable me to become healthy again. When you do that, I will be able to pay back my enemies.


## Psalms 41:11 (id: 1019041011)

11If you enable me to do that, with the result that my enemies do not defeat me, I will know that you are pleased with me.


## Psalms 41:12 (id: 1019041012)

12I will know that it is because I have done what is right that you have helped me, and I will know that you will enable me to be with you forever.


## Psalms 41:13 (id: 1019041013)

13Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites worship; Praise him forever! Amen! I desire that it will be so!


## Psalms 42:1 (id: 1019042001)

1A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director; In the same way that a deer desires to drink water in a dry place, so I desire you, O God.


## Psalms 42:2 (id: 1019042002)

2I desire to be with you so desperately, O you, the real God. It is as though I am thirsting for water. I say to myself, “I shall certainly return to the temple in Israel and worship in your presence again, O God!”


## Psalms 42:3 (id: 1019042003)

3Every day and every night I weep, and the only thing I have to drink is my tears. This is because my enemies are always asking me, “Your God will certainly not help you!”


## Psalms 42:4 (id: 1019042004)

4I am sorrowful, as I remember when I used to go with the large groups of people to the temple where God dwelt in Jerusalem. On our way to the festival, we would all shout joyfully and sing to thank God for what he had done.


## Psalms 42:5 (id: 1019042005)

5So now I say to myself, “You certainly should not be sad and troubled! Confidently expect for God to rescue you! Then you will once again praise him, because of how he has saved you”


## Psalms 42:6 (id: 1019042006)

6O my God, I am discouraged, so I think about you. Your presence is refreshing, like the abundant waters of Jordan River that rush down from the peaks of Mount Hermon and from Mount Mizar.


## Psalms 42:7 (id: 1019042007)

7I am in turmoil like the rush of loud waterfalls. I am troubled as if many waves were crashing over me.


## Psalms 42:8 (id: 1019042008)

8Yahweh faithfully loves me every day, and so he causes me to sing to him every night a prayer to God, who keeps me alive.


## Psalms 42:9 (id: 1019042009)

9I say to God, who is like a huge rock on top of which I am safe {from attackers}, “Surely you have forgotten me! I am living sorrowfully because my enemies are afflicting me”


## Psalms 42:10 (id: 1019042010)

10My foes are always insulting me. They keep saying to me, “Your God will not help you!” When they insult me like that, it is like wounds that break my bones.


## Psalms 42:11 (id: 1019042011)

11But now I say to myself, “You certainly should not be sad and troubled! Confidently expect for God to rescue you! Then you will once again praise him, because of how he has saved you.”


## Psalms 43:1 (id: 1019043001)

1O God, announce that I am innocent. Defend me when people try to accuse me of doing evil, people who are unfaithful to you! Rescue me from people who deceive me and lie about me.


## Psalms 43:2 (id: 1019043002)

2{I expect you to do this} since you are the God who protects me, and yet you have abandoned me! I am living sorrowfully because my enemies are afflicting me.


## Psalms 43:3 (id: 1019043003)

3Speak words that drive away my oppressors, as light causes darkness to cease. Say truthful words to me! This will allow me to return to your temple on Mount Zion, where you dwell.


## Psalms 43:4 (id: 1019043004)

4After I come to Zion, I will go to your altar to worship you, O God, who causes me to be very joyful. There I will praise you, the God whom I worship, by playing the harp.


## Psalms 43:5 (id: 1019043005)

5But now I say to myself, “You certainly should not be sad and troubled! Confidently expect for God to rescue you! Then you will once again praise him, because of how he has saved you.”


## Psalms 44:1 (id: 1019044001)

1A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director. God, we ourselves have heard what our ancestors told us. They told us about the amazing wonders that you performed long ago.


## Psalms 44:2 (id: 1019044002)

2They told us about how you powerfully expelled the ungodly people and settled our ancestors in their land, as one plants a plant. They also told us that you punished those ungodly people and brought our ancestors into the land.


## Psalms 44:3 (id: 1019044003)

3It was not because our ancestors had a strong military that they conquered the people that lived in that land. Similarly, it was not because they were powerful that they were victorious. Rather, it was because you are powerful and desired to favor them that they did those things, for you delighted in them.


## Psalms 44:4 (id: 1019044004)

4You rule over me like a king, God. Empower your people to defeat our enemies.


## Psalms 44:5 (id: 1019044005)

5You empower us to defeat our enemies, and because of you we completely overwhelm those who fight against us.


## Psalms 44:6 (id: 1019044006)

6I do not trust that I can save myself by using my bow and arrows and my sword.


## Psalms 44:7 (id: 1019044007)

7This is because you have rescued us from our enemies. This is because you have disgraced our adversaries by defeating them.


## Psalms 44:8 (id: 1019044008)

8We have always been proud about what God has done for us, and we will thank him forever.


## Psalms 44:9 (id: 1019044009)

9But now you have rejected us and embarrassed us. When our armies march out to fight a battle, you no longer go with them to empower them to be victorious.


## Psalms 44:10 (id: 1019044010)

10You have caused us to retreat from our enemies, and they robbed anything they wanted from us.


## Psalms 44:11 (id: 1019044011)

11You have made us helpless victims to our enemies, like sheep that people are about to kill in order to eat. You have spread us out among many foreign peoples.


## Psalms 44:12 (id: 1019044012)

12You allowed our enemies to take us captive. It is as though you sold us to them for a very small price. You did not gain any profit from selling us!


## Psalms 44:13 (id: 1019044013)

13You have caused our neighbors to reproach us. They laugh at us and deride us.


## Psalms 44:14 (id: 1019044014)

14You caused them to make jokes about our country, and to shake their heads to indicate that they despise us.


## Psalms 44:15 (id: 1019044015)

15People constantly make me think about how I am disgraceful, and I am completely shameful.


## Psalms 44:16 (id: 1019044016)

16This happens because people speak harshly to me, My enemies and those who want to harm me shame me.


## Psalms 44:17 (id: 1019044017)

17All of these things have happened to us, even though we have not ceased from worshipping you, and we have not disobeyed the agreement that you made with our ancestors.


## Psalms 44:18 (id: 1019044018)

18We have continued to be loyal to you, and we have continued doing what you have commanded us to do.


## Psalms 44:19 (id: 1019044019)

19But it is as though you have destroyed us in battle, so that our bodies are laying in a place where wild animals could eat them. It is also as though you have thrown us into a very dark place.


## Psalms 44:20 (id: 1019044020)

20If we had stopped worshipping you, our God, and began worshipping a foreign god,


## Psalms 44:21 (id: 1019044021)

21you surely would have known that. This is because you know even what we secretly think.


## Psalms 44:22 (id: 1019044022)

22It is surely because you allow our enemies to attack us that they are constantly killing us. They kill us easily, for we are as defenseless as sheep that people kill in order to eat them.


## Psalms 44:23 (id: 1019044023)

23Defend us, Yahweh! It certainly seems as though you are asleep! Help us! Do not treat us as though we are not your people forever!


## Psalms 44:24 (id: 1019044024)

24You certainly are not favoring us! You surely are not saving us from our afflicters and oppressors.


## Psalms 44:25 (id: 1019044025)

25We have fallen down hopelessly, with our bellies on the ground.


## Psalms 44:26 (id: 1019044026)

26Rescue us! Come and help us! Save us from our enemies, for you promised to love us faithfully.


## Psalms 45:1 (id: 1019045001)

1A love song written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director, to be sung to the tune “Lilies.” In my inner being I am aroused by something beautiful to write about, a song that I will sing to the king. The words of this song will be written by me, a skilled writer.


## Psalms 45:2 (id: 1019045002)

2O King, you are the most handsome man in the world, and you always speak eloquently! So we know that God has always blessed you.


## Psalms 45:3 (id: 1019045003)

3You who are a mighty warrior, put on your sword! You are glorious and majestic.


## Psalms 45:4 (id: 1019045004)

4Ride on like a great king to defend the truth that you speak and the fair decisions that you make! Because you fight in many battles, you will learn to do deeds that your enemies will fear.


## Psalms 45:5 (id: 1019045005)

5Your arrows are sharp, and they pierce the hearts of your enemies. Soldiers of many nations will fall at your feet.


## Psalms 45:6 (id: 1019045006)

6The kingdom that God will give to you will remain forever. You rule over people justly.


## Psalms 45:7 (id: 1019045007)

7You love right actions, and you hate evil actions. Therefore God, your God, has chosen you to be king and has caused you to be happier than any other king.


## Psalms 45:8 (id: 1019045008)

8The perfume of various spices is on your robes. Musicians entertain you in ivory palaces by playing stringed instruments.


## Psalms 45:9 (id: 1019045009)

9Among your wives are daughters of other kings. At your right hand stands your bride, the queen, wearing beautiful ornaments of gold that comes from Ophir.


## Psalms 45:10 (id: 1019045010)

10Now I will say something to your bride: “Listen to me carefully! Forget the people who live in your home country, forget your relatives!


## Psalms 45:11 (id: 1019045011)

11Because you are very beautiful, the king will desire to be with you. He is your master, so you must obey him.


## Psalms 45:12 (id: 1019045012)

12The people from the city of Tyre will bring gifts to you; their rich people will try to persuade you to do favors for them.


## Psalms 45:13 (id: 1019045013)

13You, the king’s bride, enter the palace wearing beautiful robes made from gold thread.”


## Psalms 45:14 (id: 1019045014)

14O king, while she is wearing a gown that has many colors, her woman servants will lead her to you. She will have many other young women who accompany her.


## Psalms 45:15 (id: 1019045015)

15They will be very joyful as they are led along to enter your palace.


## Psalms 45:16 (id: 1019045016)

16Someday, your sons and your grandsons will become kings, just as your ancestors were. You will enable them to become rulers in many countries.


## Psalms 45:17 (id: 1019045017)

17As for me, I will enable people in every generation to remember the great things that you have done, and people will praise you forever.


## Psalms 46:1 (id: 1019046001)

1A psalm written by one of the descendants of Korah for the choir director. God is the one who protects us and causes us to be strong; he is always ready to help us when we have troubles.


## Psalms 46:2 (id: 1019046002)

2So, even if the earth shakes, we will not be afraid. Even if the mountains fall into the middle of the sea,


## Psalms 46:3 (id: 1019046003)

3and if the water in the sea roars and foams, and if the hills shake violently, we will not be afraid!


## Psalms 46:4 (id: 1019046004)

4Blessings that come from God are like a river that makes everyone in the city joyful, there where we worship him. It is the city where the temple of God, who is greater than any other god, exists.


## Psalms 46:5 (id: 1019046005)

5God is in this city, and it will never be destroyed; he will come to help the people in that city at dawn every day.


## Psalms 46:6 (id: 1019046006)

6Sometimes the people of many nations are terrified; kingdoms are overthrown; God speaks loudly like thunder, and the earth melts.


## Psalms 46:7 (id: 1019046007)

7But Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, is with us; the God whom Jacob worshiped is our refuge.


## Psalms 46:8 (id: 1019046008)

8Come and see the things that Yahweh does! Come and see the things he has destroyed all over the earth.


## Psalms 46:9 (id: 1019046009)

9He stops wars all over the world; he breaks bows and arrows; he destroys spears; he burns up shields.


## Psalms 46:10 (id: 1019046010)

10God says, “Be quiet and remember that I am God! People of all nations will honor me. People all over the earth will honor me.”


## Psalms 46:11 (id: 1019046011)

11So never forget that Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, is with us; the God whom Jacob worshiped is our refuge.

2Yahweh, who is much greater than any other god, is awesome; he is a king who rules over all the world!


## Psalms 47:3 (id: 1019047003)

3He enabled us to defeat the armies of the people groups that lived in Canaan.

4He chose for us this land where we now live; we Israelite people, whom he loves, are proud that we own this land.

6Because they were very afraid, they trembled like a woman who is about to give birth to a child.


## Psalms 48:7 (id: 1019048007)

7They shook as ships sailing from Tarshish shake in a strong wind.


## Psalms 48:8 (id: 1019048008)

## Psalms 49:7 (id: 1019049007)

7They may be rich, but no one can pay God money so that he can live forever! No one can pay God enough so that God will allow him to continue to live


## Psalms 49:8 (id: 1019049008)

8because that cost is too much, and he will never be able to pay enough.


## Psalms 49:9 (id: 1019049009)

9No one can pay God enough money so that he will live forever and never die and be buried!


## Psalms 49:10 (id: 1019049010)

10We see that foolish and stupid people die, but we see that wise people also die; they all leave their wealth, and others inherit it.


## Psalms 49:11 (id: 1019049011)

11They once had houses on land that they owned, but now their graves are their homes forever, the place where they will stay for all time!


## Psalms 49:12 (id: 1019049012)

12Even if people are great, that cannot prevent them from dying; people all die, the same as the animals do.


## Psalms 49:13 (id: 1019049013)

13That is what happens to those who foolishly trust in what they have accomplished, to those who are delighted in all that they possess.


## Psalms 49:14 (id: 1019049014)

14They are certain to die just like sheep when a shepherd leads them away to be slaughtered. In the morning the righteous people will rule over them, and then those wealthy people will die and their bodies will quickly decay in their graves; they will be where dead people are, far from their homes.


## Psalms 49:15 (id: 1019049015)

15But it is certain that God will rescue me so that I am not held fast in the place of the dead; he will take me to himself.


## Psalms 49:16 (id: 1019049016)

16So do not be dismayed when someone becomes rich and the houses where they live become more and more luxurious;


## Psalms 49:17 (id: 1019049017)

17for when he dies, he will take nothing with him; his wealth will not go with him.


## Psalms 49:18 (id: 1019049018)

18While a rich person is alive, he congratulates himself, and people praise him for being successful,


## Psalms 49:19 (id: 1019049019)

19but he will die and join his ancestors, who will never see daylight again.


## Psalms 49:20 (id: 1019049020)

20Even if someone is great, that cannot prevent him from dying; he will die, the same as the animals do.


## Psalms 50:1 (id: 1019050001)

1A psalm written by Asaph; God, the all\-powerful one, speaks; he summons all people, from the east to the west.


## Psalms 50:2 (id: 1019050002)

2His glory shines from Mount Zion in Jerusalem, an extremely beautiful city.


## Psalms 50:3 (id: 1019050003)

3Our God comes to us, and he is not silent. A great fire is in front of him, and a storm is around him.


## Psalms 50:4 (id: 1019050004)

4He comes to judge his people. He shouts to the angels in heaven and to the people on the earth.


## Psalms 50:5 (id: 1019050005)

5He says, “Summon those who faithfully worship me, those who made a covenant with me by offering sacrifices to me.”


## Psalms 50:6 (id: 1019050006)

6The angels in heaven declare, “God is righteous, and he is the supreme judge.”


## Psalms 50:7 (id: 1019050007)

7God says, “My people, listen! You Israelite people, listen, as I, your God, say what you have done that is wrong.


## Psalms 50:8 (id: 1019050008)

8I am not rebuking you for making sacrifices to me, for the offerings that you always burn on the altar for me.


## Psalms 50:9 (id: 1019050009)

9But I do not really need the bulls from your barns and the goats from your pens that you sacrifice,


## Psalms 50:10 (id: 1019050010)

10because all the animals in the forest belong to me, and all the cattle on a thousand hills also belong to me.


## Psalms 50:11 (id: 1019050011)

11I know and own all the birds in the mountains, and all the creatures that move around in the fields.


## Psalms 50:12 (id: 1019050012)

12So if I were hungry, I would not tell you to bring me some food because everything in the world belongs to me!


## Psalms 50:13 (id: 1019050013)

13I do not eat the flesh of the bulls that you sacrifice, and I do not drink the blood of the goats that you offer to me.


## Psalms 50:14 (id: 1019050014)

14The sacrifice that I really want is that you thank me and do all that you have promised to do.


## Psalms 50:15 (id: 1019050015)

15Pray to me when you have troubles. If you do that, I will rescue you, and then you will praise me.


## Psalms 50:16 (id: 1019050016)

16But I say this to the wicked people: Why do you recite my commandments or talk about the covenant that I made with you?


## Psalms 50:17 (id: 1019050017)

17For you have refused to allow me to discipline you, and you have rejected what I told you to do.


## Psalms 50:18 (id: 1019050018)

18Every time that you see a thief, you become his friend, and you spend much time with those who commit adultery.


## Psalms 50:19 (id: 1019050019)

19You are always talking about doing wicked things, and you are always trying to deceive people.


## Psalms 50:20 (id: 1019050020)

20You are always accusing members of your own family and slandering them.


## Psalms 50:21 (id: 1019050021)

21You did all those things, and I did not say anything to you, so you thought that I was a sinner just like you. But now I rebuke you and accuse you, right in front of you.


## Psalms 50:22 (id: 1019050022)

22So, all you who have ignored me, pay attention to this, because if you do not, I will tear you to pieces, and there will be no one to rescue you.


## Psalms 50:23 (id: 1019050023)

23The sacrifice that truly honors me is to thank me for what I have done; and I will save those who always do the things that I want them to.”


## Psalms 51:1 (id: 1019051001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time when the prophet Nathan rebuked David after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba. O God, act mercifully toward me because you love me faithfully; because you are very merciful, forget the ways that I disobeyed you!


## Psalms 51:2 (id: 1019051002)

2Make me acceptable to you again, even though I did wrong things; forgive the guilt of my sin and accept me.


## Psalms 51:3 (id: 1019051003)

3I say that because I know the ways that I have disobeyed you; I cannot forget them.


## Psalms 51:4 (id: 1019051004)

4You, you only, are the one I have really sinned against, and you have seen the evil things that I have done. When you say that I am guilty, you are right, and when you judge me, you justly say that I deserve to be punished.


## Psalms 51:5 (id: 1019051005)

5I have been a sinner since the day that I was born; truly, I have been like that since my mother conceived me.


## Psalms 51:6 (id: 1019051006)

6What you desire is that in my inner being I desire what is true in order that you can teach me how to act wisely.


## Psalms 51:7 (id: 1019051007)

7Forgive the guilt of my sins, and after that happens, I will be completely acceptable to you; if you forgive me, then I will be absolutely right with you.


## Psalms 51:8 (id: 1019051008)

8Allow me to rejoice again; you have made me immeasurably sad, but now let me rejoice again.


## Psalms 51:9 (id: 1019051009)

9Do not continue to remember the sins that I have committed; forget the evil things that I have done.


## Psalms 51:10 (id: 1019051010)

10O God, make me want to do the things that you approve of. Make me want to do only what is right.


## Psalms 51:11 (id: 1019051011)

11Do not reject me as one of your people, and do not make your holy Spirit leave me.


## Psalms 51:12 (id: 1019051012)

12Make me happy again by rescuing me from my guilt, and always help me by making me sincerely want to obey you.


## Psalms 51:13 (id: 1019051013)

13If you do that, I will teach other sinners what you want them to do; they will repent and obey you.


## Psalms 51:14 (id: 1019051014)

14O God, you are the one who saves me; forgive me for being guilty of causing someone who was not my enemy to die. When you do that, I will sing joyfully about your being very good and righteous.


## Psalms 51:15 (id: 1019051015)

15O Yahweh, help me to speak in order that I may praise you.


## Psalms 51:16 (id: 1019051016)

16When people only bring sacrifices to you, that does not please you. If that were enough to please you, I would do the same. But you are not pleased with burnt offerings alone.


## Psalms 51:17 (id: 1019051017)

17The sacrifice that you really want is for people to be truly humble and sorry for having sinned. O God, you will not refuse that kind of sacrifice.


## Psalms 51:18 (id: 1019051018)

18O God, be good to the people who live in Jerusalem; make them able to rebuild the city walls.


## Psalms 51:19 (id: 1019051019)

19When that happens, they will bring you the proper sacrifices: normal animal sacrifices and sacrifices to be completely burned. They will burn young bulls on your altar, and you will be pleased.


## Psalms 52:1 (id: 1019052001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director when Doeg went to Saul and said, “David has gone to talk with Ahimelech, the high priest.” You proud man, you think that you are strong; you boast about the trouble that you make for others, but God faithfully protects people from you every day.


## Psalms 52:2 (id: 1019052002)

2All during the day you plan to get rid of others; what you say is like a sharp blade, and you are always deceiving others.


## Psalms 52:3 (id: 1019052003)

3You like doing what is evil more than you like doing what is good, and you like telling lies more than you like telling the truth.


## Psalms 52:4 (id: 1019052004)

4You, the one who says things to deceive people, you like to say things that hurt people!


## Psalms 52:5 (id: 1019052005)

5But God will get rid of you forever; he will grab you and drag you from your home and take you away from this world where people are alive.


## Psalms 52:6 (id: 1019052006)

6When righteous people see that, they will be awestruck, and they will laugh at what happened to you, and say,


## Psalms 52:7 (id: 1019052007)

7“Look what happened to the man who would not ask God to protect him; he trusted that his great wealth would save him; he grew more powerful by wickedly hurting other people.”


## Psalms 52:8 (id: 1019052008)

8But I am secure because I worship in God’s temple; I am like a strong green olive tree. I trust in God, who faithfully loves us forever.


## Psalms 52:9 (id: 1019052009)

9God, I will always thank you for everything you have done. I will wait patiently because you are so good, especially when I stand before your faithful people.


## Psalms 53:1 (id: 1019053001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using a tune called “Mahalath.” Only foolish people say to themselves, “There is no God!” People who say that are corrupt; they commit terrible sins; there is not one of them who does what is good.


## Psalms 53:2 (id: 1019053002)

2God looks down from heaven and sees humans; he looks to see if any man is very wise and seeks to know God.


## Psalms 53:3 (id: 1019053003)

3But everyone has turned away from God. They are depraved and do disgusting, filthy things. No one does what is good.


## Psalms 53:4 (id: 1019053004)

4Will all these evil people never learn what God will do to them? They hurt Yahweh’s people with terrible violence. They had no guilt in what they did. They had the same expression on their faces as people eating bread at dinner. And what is worse is that they never prayed to Yahweh.


## Psalms 53:5 (id: 1019053005)

5But someday those people will become very terrified, although they have nothing to fear. For God will cause those who attack you to die, and he will scatter their bones. They have rejected God, so he will cause them to be defeated and completely disgraced.


## Psalms 53:6 (id: 1019053006)

6I wish that God would come and rescue the Israelite people! God, when you bless your people again, all the Israelite people, all the descendants of Jacob, will rejoice.


## Psalms 54:1 (id: 1019054001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; it was written when the people of Ziph went to Saul and told him that David was hiding in their area. God, by your power save me from my enemies, and show people that I have not done anything that is wrong!


## Psalms 54:2 (id: 1019054002)

2God, listen to my prayer; listen to what I say to you


## Psalms 54:3 (id: 1019054003)

3because strangers are trying to attack me; proud men are wanting to kill me, men who have no respect for you.


## Psalms 54:4 (id: 1019054004)

4But God is the one who helps me; Yahweh defends me from my enemies.


## Psalms 54:5 (id: 1019054005)

5He will cause the evil things that they want to do to me to happen to them instead; because you faithfully do what you have promised to me, destroy them.


## Psalms 54:6 (id: 1019054006)

6Yahweh, I will gladly give an offering to you because I want to, and I will thank you, for you are good to me;


## Psalms 54:7 (id: 1019054007)

7you have rescued me from all my troubles, and I have seen that you have defeated my enemies.


## Psalms 55:1 (id: 1019055001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; God, listen to my prayer, and do not turn away from me while I am pleading with you.


## Psalms 55:2 (id: 1019055002)

2Listen to me and answer me because I am overwhelmed by all my troubles.


## Psalms 55:3 (id: 1019055003)

3My enemies terrify me; wicked people oppress me. They cause me to have great troubles; they are angry with me, and they hate me.


## Psalms 55:4 (id: 1019055004)

4I am terrified, and I am very much afraid that I will die.


## Psalms 55:5 (id: 1019055005)

5I am very fearful and I tremble; I am completely terrified.


## Psalms 55:6 (id: 1019055006)

6I said, “I wish that I had wings like a dove! If I had wings, I would fly away and find a place to rest.


## Psalms 55:7 (id: 1019055007)

7I would fly far away and live in the wilderness.


## Psalms 55:8 (id: 1019055008)

8I would quickly find a safe place where my enemies could not strike me like a strong wind and rainstorm.”


## Psalms 55:9 (id: 1019055009)

9Lord, confuse my enemies and cause their plans to fail. I saw them hurting others by their violence and causing riots throughout the city.


## Psalms 55:10 (id: 1019055010)

10During each day and night they march around on top of its walls, committing crimes and causing trouble.


## Psalms 55:11 (id: 1019055011)

11They destroy things everywhere. They oppress people and defraud people in the marketplaces.


## Psalms 55:12 (id: 1019055012)

12If it were an enemy who was making fun of me, I could endure it. If it were someone who hates me, who despises me, I could hide from him.


## Psalms 55:13 (id: 1019055013)

13But it is someone who is just like me, my companion, someone who was my friend who is doing this to me.


## Psalms 55:14 (id: 1019055014)

14We previously had many good talks together; we walked around together in God’s temple.


## Psalms 55:15 (id: 1019055015)

15I desire that my enemies will go down alive to the place where the dead people are. I want this because they do evil things in their homes.


## Psalms 55:16 (id: 1019055016)

16But I will ask Yahweh, my God, to help me, and he will save me.


## Psalms 55:17 (id: 1019055017)

17Each morning, noontime, and evening I tell him what I am concerned about, and I moan, and he hears my voice.


## Psalms 55:18 (id: 1019055018)

18He saves my life and makes me safe when I am fighting a terrible battle against my enemies. There are many enemies coming to fight against me!


## Psalms 55:19 (id: 1019055019)

19God is the one who has ruled everything forever, and he will put those who fought against me in their place. He will cause my enemies to be defeated and disgraced because they do not change their evil behavior and because they do not have any respect for God.


## Psalms 55:20 (id: 1019055020)

20My companion, whom I mentioned previously, betrayed his friends and broke the agreement that he made with them.


## Psalms 55:21 (id: 1019055021)

21What he said was as easy to listen to as butter is easy to swallow, but in his inner being he hated people; his words were as soothing as olive oil, but they hurt people as sharp swords do.


## Psalms 55:22 (id: 1019055022)

22Put your troubles in Yahweh’s hands, and he will take care of you; he will never allow disaster to destroy righteous people.


## Psalms 55:23 (id: 1019055023)

23God, you will cause murderers and liars to die before they have lived half as long as they expect to live; but as for me, I will trust in you.


## Psalms 56:1 (id: 1019056001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director, concerning the time the Philistines seized David in Gath; to be sung using the tune “Dove on distant oaks.” God, act mercifully toward me because men are attacking me! All day long an enemy presses closer and closer to me because they want to take my life.


## Psalms 56:2 (id: 1019056002)

2All day long my enemies seek to crush the life from me, there are many enemies attacking me!


## Psalms 56:3 (id: 1019056003)

3But whenever I am afraid, I trust in you.


## Psalms 56:4 (id: 1019056004)

4God, I praise you because you do what you have promised; I trust in you, and then I am not afraid. Ordinary humans certainly cannot harm me!


## Psalms 56:5 (id: 1019056005)

5All day long my enemies claim that I said things that I did not say; they are always thinking of ways to harm me.


## Psalms 56:6 (id: 1019056006)

6In order to cause trouble for me, they hide and watch everything that I do, waiting for an opportunity to kill me.


## Psalms 56:7 (id: 1019056007)

7So, God, punish them for the wicked things that they are doing; show that you are angry by defeating those people!


## Psalms 56:8 (id: 1019056008)

8You have counted all the times that I have been wandering alone; it is as though you have put all my tears in a bottle so that you can see how much I have cried. You have counted my tears and written the number in your book.


## Psalms 56:9 (id: 1019056009)

9When I call out to you, my God, my enemies will be defeated; I know that will happen because you are fighting for me.


## Psalms 56:10 (id: 1019056010)

10I praise you that you do what you have promised; Yahweh, I will always praise you for that.


## Psalms 56:11 (id: 1019056011)

11I trust in you, and as a result, I will not be afraid. I know that humans cannot really harm me!


## Psalms 56:12 (id: 1019056012)

12I will bring to you the offering that I promised; I will bring an offering to you to thank you


## Psalms 56:13 (id: 1019056013)

13because you have rescued me from being killed; you have kept me from stumbling. And so I will continue to live with God every day in his light that gives me life.


## Psalms 57:1 (id: 1019057001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director, when David went into a cave to escape from Saul; to be sung using the tune “Do not destroy.” God, act mercifully toward me! Act mercifully toward me because I am coming to you to protect me. I request you to protect me as little birds are protected under their mother’s wings until the storm is ended.


## Psalms 57:2 (id: 1019057002)

2God, you who are greater than all other gods, I cry out to you, the one who enables me to be all that you desire.


## Psalms 57:3 (id: 1019057003)

3You will answer me from heaven and rescue me, but you will cause those who oppress me to be defeated and disgraced! God will always faithfully love me as he has promised me.


## Psalms 57:4 (id: 1019057004)

4Sometimes I am surrounded by my enemies, who are as ready to kill me as lions are to kill people; they are like lions that chew to bits the animals that they kill. But my enemies are human, and they have spears and arrows, not teeth; they say false things about me.


## Psalms 57:5 (id: 1019057005)

5God, show in the heavens that you are very great! Show your glory to people all over the earth!


## Psalms 57:6 (id: 1019057006)

6It is as if my enemies have spread a net to seize me, and I became very distressed. It is as if they have dug a deep pit along the path where I walk, but they themselves fell into it!


## Psalms 57:7 (id: 1019057007)

7God, I am very confident in you. I will sing to you, and I will praise you while I sing.


## Psalms 57:8 (id: 1019057008)

8It is an honor to wake up and praise you. I will arise before the sun rises and praise you while I play my big harp or my lyre.


## Psalms 57:9 (id: 1019057009)

9Lord, I will thank you among all the people; and I will sing songs of praise about you to many people groups.


## Psalms 57:10 (id: 1019057010)

10For your love for us is as great as the distance from the earth to the sky, and your faithfulness to us goes up to the clouds.


## Psalms 57:11 (id: 1019057011)

11God, show in the heavens that you are very great! Show your glory to people all over the earth!


## Psalms 58:1 (id: 1019058001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director, to be sung using the tune “Do not destroy.” When you rulers speak, you never say what is right; you people never justly decide disputes.


## Psalms 58:2 (id: 1019058002)

2No, in your inner beings you think only about doing what is wrong, and you commit violent crimes everywhere in this land of Israel.


## Psalms 58:3 (id: 1019058003)

3Wicked people do wrong things and tell lies from the time that they are born.


## Psalms 58:4 (id: 1019058004)

4What wicked people say injures people like the venom of a snake. They refuse to listen to commands; it is as though they were deaf cobras.


## Psalms 58:5 (id: 1019058005)

5As a result, like a snake that does not respond when a charmer plays a flute or when someone sings magic songs, they do not pay attention when others rebuke them.


## Psalms 58:6 (id: 1019058006)

6God, as for these enemies who want to attack me like young lions, break the teeth in their mouths!


## Psalms 58:7 (id: 1019058007)

7Cause them to disappear as water disappears in dry ground! Cause the arrows that they shoot to have no heads!


## Psalms 58:8 (id: 1019058008)

8Cause them to become like snails that disappear in the slime; cause them to be like a baby that is born dead!


## Psalms 58:9 (id: 1019058009)

9I hope that you will get rid of them as fast as thornbushes are blown away after they are cut.


## Psalms 58:10 (id: 1019058010)

10People who do what is right will rejoice when they see God punish the wicked people; they will wash their feet in the blood of wicked people.


## Psalms 58:11 (id: 1019058011)

11Then people will say, “It is true that there is a reward for righteous people; and there is indeed a God who judges people justly here on the earth!”


## Psalms 59:1 (id: 1019059001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director, when Saul, wanting to kill David, sent men to watch David’s house. God, save me from my enemies! Protect me from those who want to attack me!


## Psalms 59:2 (id: 1019059002)

2Keep me safe from men who want to do what is wicked, from men who are murderers!


## Psalms 59:3 (id: 1019059003)

3Look! They are waiting to kill me! Fierce men have gathered to assault me. Yahweh, they are doing that even though I have not done what is wrong!

5Do not be arrogant, and do not speak so boastfully!


## Psalms 75:6 (id: 1019075006)

6The one who judges people does not come from the east or from the west, and he does not come from the desert.


## Psalms 75:7 (id: 1019075007)

7God is the one who judges people; he shames and punishes some, and he honors others.


## Psalms 75:8 (id: 1019075008)

8It is as though Yahweh held a cup in his hand; it is filled with wine that has spices mixed in it to cause those who drink it to become more drunk; and when Yahweh pours it out, he will force all the wicked people to drink it; they will drink every drop of it; yes, he will punish them fully.


## Psalms 75:9 (id: 1019075009)

9But as for me, I will never stop saying what the God whom Jacob worshiped has done; I will never stop singing to praise him.


## Psalms 75:10 (id: 1019075010)

10He promises this: “I will destroy the power of wicked people, but I will increase the power of righteous people.”


## Psalms 76:1 (id: 1019076001)

1A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; God has made the people in Judah to know him; the Israelite people honor him.


## Psalms 76:2 (id: 1019076002)

2In Jerusalem is where he resides; he lives on Mount Zion.


## Psalms 76:3 (id: 1019076003)

3There he broke the flaming arrows that his enemies shot, and he also broke their shields and swords and other weapons that they used in battles.


## Psalms 76:4 (id: 1019076004)

4God, you are powerful! You are like a great king as you return from the mountains where you defeated your enemies.


## Psalms 76:5 (id: 1019076005)

5Their brave soldiers were killed, and then those who killed them took away everything that those soldiers had. Those enemies died; indeed, none of them were able to fight any longer.


## Psalms 76:6 (id: 1019076006)

6When you, the God whom Jacob worshiped, rebuked your enemies, their horses and their riders fell down dead.


## Psalms 76:7 (id: 1019076007)

7Truly, you cause everyone to be afraid. When you are angry and you punish people, no one can endure it.


## Psalms 76:8 (id: 1019076008)

8From heaven you proclaimed that you would judge people, and then everyone on the earth was afraid and did not say anything more


## Psalms 76:9 (id: 1019076009)

9when you arose to declare that you would punish wicked people and rescue all those whom they had oppressed.


## Psalms 76:10 (id: 1019076010)

10When you punish those with whom you are angry, your people will praise you, and your enemies who survive will worship you on your festival days.


## Psalms 76:11 (id: 1019076011)

11So give to Yahweh the offerings that you promised to give to him; all the people of nearby people groups should also bring gifts to him, the one who is awesome.


## Psalms 76:12 (id: 1019076012)

12He humbles the leaders, and terrifies all the kings.


## Psalms 77:1 (id: 1019077001)

1A psalm written by Asaph for Jeduthun, the choir director; I will cry out to God; I will cry aloud to him, and he will listen to me.


## Psalms 77:2 (id: 1019077002)

2At the time that I had trouble, I prayed to the Lord; all during the night I lifted up my hands while I prayed, but nothing could comfort me.


## Psalms 77:3 (id: 1019077003)

3When I thought about God, I despaired; when I meditated about him, I grew discouraged.


## Psalms 77:4 (id: 1019077004)

4All during the night he prevented me from sleeping; I was so worried that I did not know what to say.


## Psalms 77:5 (id: 1019077005)

5I thought about days that had passed; I remembered what had happened in previous years.


## Psalms 77:6 (id: 1019077006)

6I spent all the night thinking about things; I meditated, and this is what I asked myself:


## Psalms 77:7 (id: 1019077007)

7“Will the Lord always reject me? Will he never again be pleased with me?


## Psalms 77:8 (id: 1019077008)

8Has he stopped faithfully loving me? Will he not do for me what he promised to do?


## Psalms 77:9 (id: 1019077009)

9God promised to act mercifully toward me; has he forgotten that? Because he is angry with me, has he decided not to be kind to me?”


## Psalms 77:10 (id: 1019077010)

10I said, “What causes me to be sad the most is that it seems that God, who is greater than any other god, is no longer using his power for us.”


## Psalms 77:11 (id: 1019077011)

11But then, Yahweh, I recall your great deeds; I remember the wonderful things that you did in the past.


## Psalms 77:12 (id: 1019077012)

12I meditate on all that you have done, and I think about your mighty acts.


## Psalms 77:13 (id: 1019077013)

13God, everything that you do is amazing; there is certainly no god who is great like you are!


## Psalms 77:14 (id: 1019077014)

14You are God, the one who performs miracles; you showed to the people of many people groups that you are powerful.


## Psalms 77:15 (id: 1019077015)

15By your power you rescued your people from Egypt; you saved those who were descendants of Jacob and his son Joseph.


## Psalms 77:16 (id: 1019077016)

16It was as though the waters saw you and became very afraid, and even the deepest part of the water shook.


## Psalms 77:17 (id: 1019077017)

17Rain poured down from the clouds; it thundered very loudly, and lightning flashed in all directions.


## Psalms 77:18 (id: 1019077018)

18Thunder crashed in the whirlwind—your voice! Lightning lit up, and the earth shook violently.


## Psalms 77:19 (id: 1019077019)

19Then you walked through the sea in a path that you made through the deep water, but your footprints could not be seen.


## Psalms 77:20 (id: 1019077020)

20You led your people as a shepherd leads his flock of sheep while Moses and Aaron were the leaders of your people.


## Psalms 78:1 (id: 1019078001)

1A psalm written by Asaph; My friends, listen to what I am going to teach you; pay careful attention to what I will say.


## Psalms 78:2 (id: 1019078002)

2I am going to give you some sayings that wise people have said. They will be sayings about things that happened long ago, things that were difficult to understand.


## Psalms 78:3 (id: 1019078003)

3These are things that we have heard and known previously, things that our parents and grandparents told us.


## Psalms 78:4 (id: 1019078004)

4We will tell these things to our children, but we will also tell our grandchildren about Yahweh’s power and the glorious things that he has done.


## Psalms 78:5 (id: 1019078005)

5He gave laws and commandments to the Israelite people, those who are the descendants of Jacob, and he told our ancestors to teach them to their children.


## Psalms 78:6 (id: 1019078006)

6He commanded this so that their children would also know them and so that they would teach them to their own children.


## Psalms 78:7 (id: 1019078007)

7In that way, they also would trust in God and would not forget the things that he has done; instead, they would obey his commandments.


## Psalms 78:8 (id: 1019078008)

8They would not be like their ancestors, who were very stubborn and kept rebelling against God; they did not continue firmly trusting in God, and they did not worship him alone.


## Psalms 78:9 (id: 1019078009)

9The soldiers of the tribe of Ephraim had bows and arrows, but they ran away from their enemies on the day that they fought with their enemies.


## Psalms 78:10 (id: 1019078010)

10They did not do what they had agreed with God that they would do; they refused to obey his laws.


## Psalms 78:11 (id: 1019078011)

11They forgot what he had done; they forgot about the miracles that they had seen him perform.


## Psalms 78:12 (id: 1019078012)

12While our ancestors were watching, God performed miracles in the area around the city of Zoan in Egypt.


## Psalms 78:13 (id: 1019078013)

13Then he caused the Sea of Reeds to divide, causing the water on each side to pile up like a wall, with the result that our ancestors walked through it on dry ground.


## Psalms 78:14 (id: 1019078014)

14He led them by a bright cloud during the day and by a fiery light during the night.


## Psalms 78:15 (id: 1019078015)

15He split rocks open in the wilderness and gave to our ancestors plenty of water from deep inside the earth.


## Psalms 78:16 (id: 1019078016)

16He caused a stream of water to flow from the rock; the water flowed like a river.


## Psalms 78:17 (id: 1019078017)

17But our ancestors continued to sin against God; in the wilderness they rebelled against the one who is greater than any other god.


## Psalms 78:18 (id: 1019078018)

18By demanding that God give them the food that they desired, they tried to find out if he would always do what they requested him to do.


## Psalms 78:19 (id: 1019078019)

19They insulted God by saying, “Can God supply food for us here in this desert?


## Psalms 78:20 (id: 1019078020)

20It is true that he struck the rock, with the result that water gushed out, but can he also provide bread and meat for us, his people?”


## Psalms 78:21 (id: 1019078021)

21So when Yahweh heard that, he became very angry, and he sent a fire to burn up some of his Israelite people.


## Psalms 78:22 (id: 1019078022)

22He did that because they did not trust in him, and they did not believe that he would rescue them.


## Psalms 78:23 (id: 1019078023)

23But God spoke to the sky above them and commanded it to open like a door,


## Psalms 78:24 (id: 1019078024)

24and then food fell down like rain, food that they named “manna.” God gave them grain from heaven.


## Psalms 78:25 (id: 1019078025)

25So the people ate the food that angels eat, and God gave to them all the manna that they wanted.


## Psalms 78:26 (id: 1019078026)

26Later, he caused the wind to blow from the east, and by his power he also sent wind from the south,


## Psalms 78:27 (id: 1019078027)

27and the wind brought birds which were as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore.


## Psalms 78:28 (id: 1019078028)

28God caused those birds to fall in the middle of their camp. There were birds all around their tents.


## Psalms 78:29 (id: 1019078029)

29So the people cooked the birds and ate the meat; their stomachs were full because God had given them what they wanted.


## Psalms 78:30 (id: 1019078030)

30But they had not yet eaten all that they wanted.


## Psalms 78:31 (id: 1019078031)

31At that point, God was still very angry with them, and he caused their strongest men to die; he got rid of many of the finest young Israelite men.


## Psalms 78:32 (id: 1019078032)

32In spite of all this, the people continued to sin; in spite of all the miracles that God had performed, they still did not trust that he would take care of them.


## Psalms 78:33 (id: 1019078033)

33So he made them terrified all their lives; he made them die young.


## Psalms 78:34 (id: 1019078034)

34Whenever God caused some of the Israelites to die, the others would repent; they would be sorry and seriously ask God to save them.


## Psalms 78:35 (id: 1019078035)

35They would remember that God was like a huge rock on which they would be safe, and that he, who was greater than any other god, was the one who protected them.


## Psalms 78:36 (id: 1019078036)

36But they tried to deceive God by what they said; their words were all lies.


## Psalms 78:37 (id: 1019078037)

37They were not loyal to him; they ignored the covenant that he had made with them.


## Psalms 78:38 (id: 1019078038)

38But God acted mercifully toward his people. He forgave them for having sinned and did not get rid of them. Many times he refrained from becoming angry with them and restrained himself from furiously punishing them.


## Psalms 78:39 (id: 1019078039)

39He remembered that they were only humans who die, humans who disappear as quickly as a wind that blows by and then is gone.


## Psalms 78:40 (id: 1019078040)

40Many times our ancestors rebelled against God in the wilderness and made him very sad.


## Psalms 78:41 (id: 1019078041)

41Many times they did evil things to find out if they could do those things without God punishing them. They frequently caused the holy God of Israel to become angry.


## Psalms 78:42 (id: 1019078042)

42They forgot about his great power, and they forgot about the time when he rescued them from their enemies.


## Psalms 78:43 (id: 1019078043)

43They forgot about when he performed many miracles in the area near the city of Zoan in Egypt.


## Psalms 78:44 (id: 1019078044)

44He caused the Nile River to become red like blood so that the people of Egypt had no water to drink.


## Psalms 78:45 (id: 1019078045)

45He sent among the people of Egypt swarms of flies that bit them, and he sent frogs that ate up everything.


## Psalms 78:46 (id: 1019078046)

46He sent locusts to eat their crops and the other things that grew in their fields.


## Psalms 78:47 (id: 1019078047)

47He sent hail that destroyed the grapevines, and he sent more hail that ruined the figs on the sycamore trees.


## Psalms 78:48 (id: 1019078048)

48He sent hail that killed their cattle and lightning that killed their sheep and cows.


## Psalms 78:49 (id: 1019078049)

49Because God was fiercely angry with the people of Egypt, he caused them to be very distressed. The disasters that struck them were like a group of angels that destroyed everything.


## Psalms 78:50 (id: 1019078050)

50He did not lessen his anger with them, and he did not spare their lives; he sent a plague that killed many of them.


## Psalms 78:51 (id: 1019078051)

51In that plague he caused all the firstborn sons of the people of Egypt to die.


## Psalms 78:52 (id: 1019078052)

52Then he led his people out of Egypt as a shepherd leads his sheep, and he guided them while they walked through the wilderness.


## Psalms 78:53 (id: 1019078053)

53He led them safely, and they were not afraid, but their enemies were drowned in the sea.


## Psalms 78:54 (id: 1019078054)

54Later he brought them to Canaan, his sacred land, to Mount Zion, and by his power he enabled them to conquer the people who were living there.


## Psalms 78:55 (id: 1019078055)

55He expelled the people groups while his people were advancing; he assigned part of the land for each tribe to possess, and he gave the houses of those people to the Israelites.


## Psalms 78:56 (id: 1019078056)

56However, the Israelites rebelled against God, who is greater than any other God, and they did many evil things to see if they could do those things without God punishing them; they did not obey his commandments.


## Psalms 78:57 (id: 1019078057)

57Instead, as their ancestors did, they rebelled against God and were not loyal to him; they were as unreliable as a bow that breaks when you try to shoot with it.


## Psalms 78:58 (id: 1019078058)

58Because they worshiped carved images of their gods on the tops of hills, they caused God to become angry.


## Psalms 78:59 (id: 1019078059)

59He saw what they were doing and became very angry, so he rejected the Israelite people.


## Psalms 78:60 (id: 1019078060)

60He no longer appeared to them at Shiloh in the sacred tent where he had lived among them.


## Psalms 78:61 (id: 1019078061)

61He allowed their enemies to capture the sacred chest, which was the symbol of his power and his glory.


## Psalms 78:62 (id: 1019078062)

62Because he was angry with his people, he allowed their enemies to kill them.


## Psalms 78:63 (id: 1019078063)

63Young men were killed in battles, with the result that the young women had no one to marry.


## Psalms 78:64 (id: 1019078064)

64Many priests were killed by their enemies’ swords, and the people did not allow the priests’ widows to mourn.


## Psalms 78:65 (id: 1019078065)

65Later, it was as though the Lord awoke from sleeping; he was like a strong man who became angry because he drank a lot of wine.


## Psalms 78:66 (id: 1019078066)

66He pushed his enemies back and caused them to be very ashamed for a long time because they had been defeated.


## Psalms 78:67 (id: 1019078067)

67But he did not set up his tent where the people of the tribe of Ephraim lived; he did not choose their area to do that.


## Psalms 78:68 (id: 1019078068)

68Instead he chose the area where the tribe of Judah lived; he chose Mount Zion, which he loves.


## Psalms 78:69 (id: 1019078069)

69He decided to have his temple built there, high up, like his home in heaven; he caused it to be firm, like the earth, and intended that his temple would last forever.


## Psalms 78:70 (id: 1019078070)

70He chose David, who served him faithfully, and took him from the pastures


## Psalms 78:71 (id: 1019078071)

71where he was taking care of his father’s sheep, and appointed him to be the leader of the Israelites, the people who would always belong to God.


## Psalms 78:72 (id: 1019078072)

72David took care of the Israelite people sincerely and wholeheartedly, and he guided them skillfully.


## Psalms 79:1 (id: 1019079001)

1A psalm written by Asaph; God, other people groups have invaded your own land. They have desecrated your temple, and they have destroyed all the buildings in Jerusalem.


## Psalms 79:2 (id: 1019079002)

2Instead of burying the corpses of your people whom they killed, they allowed the vultures to eat the flesh of those corpses, and they also allowed wild animals to eat the corpses of your people.


## Psalms 79:3 (id: 1019079003)

3When they killed your people, your people’s blood flowed like water through the streets of Jerusalem, and there was almost no one left to bury their corpses.


## Psalms 79:4 (id: 1019079004)

4The people groups that live in countries that surround our land insult us; they laugh at us and mock us.


## Psalms 79:5 (id: 1019079005)

5Yahweh, how long will this continue? Will you be angry with us forever? Will your anger be like a fire burning within you?


## Psalms 79:6 (id: 1019079006)

6Instead of being angry with us, be angry with the people groups that do not know you! Be angry with kingdoms whose people do not pray to you


## Psalms 79:7 (id: 1019079007)

7because they have killed Israelite people and they have ruined your country.


## Psalms 79:8 (id: 1019079008)

8Do not punish us because of the sins that our ancestors committed! Act mercifully toward us now because we are very discouraged.


## Psalms 79:9 (id: 1019079009)

9God, you have saved us many times, so help us now; rescue us and forgive us for having sinned so that other people will honor you.


## Psalms 79:10 (id: 1019079010)

10It is not right that the other people groups say about us, “If their God is very powerful, why does he not help them?” Allow us to see you punishing the people of other nations in return for their shedding our blood and killing many of us, your people.


## Psalms 79:11 (id: 1019079011)

11Listen to your people groaning while they are in prison, and by your great power, free those whom our enemies say they will certainly execute.


## Psalms 79:12 (id: 1019079012)

12In return for their having often insulted you, punish them seven times as much!


## Psalms 79:13 (id: 1019079013)

13After you do that, we, whom you take care of as a shepherd takes care of his sheep, will continue praising you; we will continue to praise you from generation to generation forever.


## Psalms 80:1 (id: 1019080001)

1A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director, to be sung using the tune ‘Lilies of the covenant’ Yahweh, you who lead us as a shepherd leads his flock of sheep, you who sit on your throne in the Very Holy Place in the temple, above the figures of winged creatures, come and do powerful things for us Israelite people.


## Psalms 80:2 (id: 1019080002)

2Show yourself to the people of the tribes of Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh! Show us that you are powerful and come and rescue us!


## Psalms 80:3 (id: 1019080003)

3God, cause our nation to be strong like it was before; act kindly toward us so that we may be saved from our enemies!


## Psalms 80:4 (id: 1019080004)

4Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, how long will you be angry with us, your people, when we pray to you?


## Psalms 80:5 (id: 1019080005)

5It is as though the only food and drink that you have given us is a cup full of our tears!


## Psalms 80:6 (id: 1019080006)

6You have allowed the people groups that surround us to argue with each other to decide which part of our land each of them will take; they laugh at us.


## Psalms 80:7 (id: 1019080007)

7God, Commander of the angel armies, make our nation strong as it was before! Act kindly toward us so that we may be saved!


## Psalms 80:8 (id: 1019080008)

8Our ancestors were like a grapevine that you brought out of Egypt; you drove out the other people groups from this land, and you put your people in their land.


## Psalms 80:9 (id: 1019080009)

9As people clear ground to plant a grapevine, you cleared out the people who were living in this land for us to live in it. As the roots of a grapevine go deep down into the ground and spread, you enabled our ancestors to prosper and start living in towns all over this land.


## Psalms 80:10 (id: 1019080010)

10As huge grapevines cover the hills with their shade and as their branches are taller than big cedar trees,


## Psalms 80:11 (id: 1019080011)

11your people ruled all of Canaan, from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Euphrates River in the east.


## Psalms 80:12 (id: 1019080012)

12So why have you abandoned us and allowed our enemies to tear down our walls? You are like someone who tears down the fences around his vineyard, so that all the people who pass by can steal the grapes;


## Psalms 80:13 (id: 1019080013)

13wild pigs can trample the vines, and wild animals can also eat the grapes.


## Psalms 80:14 (id: 1019080014)

14You who are the commander of the angel armies, turn to us! Look down from heaven and see what is happening to us! Come and rescue us who are like your grapevine,


## Psalms 80:15 (id: 1019080015)

15who are like the young vine that you planted and caused to grow!


## Psalms 80:16 (id: 1019080016)

16Our enemies have torn down and burned everything in our land; look at them angrily and get rid of them!


## Psalms 80:17 (id: 1019080017)

17But strengthen us people whom you have chosen, us Israelite people, whom you previously caused to be very strong.


## Psalms 80:18 (id: 1019080018)

18When you do that, we will never turn away from you again; revive us, and then we will praise you.


## Psalms 80:19 (id: 1019080019)

19Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, restore us; act kindly toward us and rescue us from our enemies!


## Psalms 81:1 (id: 1019081001)

1A psalm written by Asaph for the choir director; Sing songs to praise God, who enables us to be strong when we fight our enemies; shout joyfully to God, whom we descendants of Jacob worship!


## Psalms 81:2 (id: 1019081002)

2Start playing the music, and beat the tambourines; play nice music on the harps and lyres.


## Psalms 81:3 (id: 1019081003)

3Blow the trumpets during the festival to celebrate each new moon, each time the moon is full, and during our other festivals.


## Psalms 81:4 (id: 1019081004)

4Do that because that is a decree for us Israelite people; it is a command that God made for the descendants of Jacob.


## Psalms 81:5 (id: 1019081005)

5He made it a law at the time when God led the descendants of Joseph out of the land of Egypt. I heard a voice I did not recognize, and it said:

13My God, cause them to disappear quickly like whirling dust, like chaff that the wind blows away!


## Psalms 83:14 (id: 1019083014)

14As a fire completely burns a forest and as flames burn in the mountains,


## Psalms 83:15 (id: 1019083015)

15expel them with your storms and cause them to be terrified by your big storms!

6I will approve of people in this land who are loyal to God, and I will allow them to live with me. I will allow to serve me those who behave in such a way that no one can criticize them.

7I will not allow anyone who deceives others to work in my palace, and no one who tells lies will be allowed to continually come to work for me.

8Every day I will try to get rid of all the wicked people in this land; I will expel them from this city, which is Yahweh’s city.


## Psalms 102:1 (id: 1019102001)

1A prayer written by someone who was afflicted, when he was discouraged and pleaded for Yahweh to help. Yahweh, listen to what I am praying; hear me while I cry out to you!


## Psalms 102:2 (id: 1019102002)

2Do not turn away! Listen to me, and answer me quickly now when I am calling out to you!


## Psalms 102:3 (id: 1019102003)

3My life is ending like smoke that disappears; I have a big fever which burns my body as a fire burns.


## Psalms 102:4 (id: 1019102004)

4I feel as though I am drying up like grass that has been mown, and I do not even think about eating any food.


## Psalms 102:5 (id: 1019102005)

5I groan loudly, and my bones can be seen under my skin because I have become very thin.


## Psalms 102:6 (id: 1019102006)

6I am like a lonely and despised vulture in the desert, like an owl by itself in the abandoned ruins of a building.


## Psalms 102:7 (id: 1019102007)

7I lie awake at night; because there is no one to comfort me, I am like a lonely bird sitting on a housetop.


## Psalms 102:8 (id: 1019102008)

8All during each day my enemies insult me; those who make fun of me mention my name and say, “May you be like him” when they curse people.


## Psalms 102:9 (id: 1019102009)

9(9\-10\) Because you are very angry with me, I sit in ashes while I am suffering greatly; those ashes fall on the bread that I eat, and what I drink has my tears mixed with it. It is as though you have picked me up and thrown me away!


## Psalms 102:11 (id: 1019102011)

11My time to remain alive is short like an evening shadow that will soon be gone. I am withering as grass withers in the hot sun.


## Psalms 102:12 (id: 1019102012)

12But Yahweh, you are our king who rules forever; people who are not yet born will remember you.


## Psalms 102:13 (id: 1019102013)

13You will arise and act mercifully toward the people of Jerusalem; it is now time for you to do that; this is the time for you to be kind to them.


## Psalms 102:14 (id: 1019102014)

14Even though the city has been destroyed, we who serve you still love the stones that were formerly in the city walls; because now there is rubble everywhere, we, your people, are very sad when we see it.


## Psalms 102:15 (id: 1019102015)

15Yahweh, someday the people of other nations will have an awesome respect for you; all the kings on the earth will see that you are very glorious.

16You will rebuild Jerusalem, and you will appear there with your glory.

## Psalms 102:19 (id: 1019102019)

19They will know that you looked down from your own place in heaven and saw what was happening on the earth.


## Psalms 102:20 (id: 1019102020)

20They will know that you hear prisoners groaning and that you will set free those who have been told, “You will be executed.”


## Psalms 102:21 (id: 1019102021)

21As a result, people in Jerusalem will praise you for what you have done.


## Psalms 102:22 (id: 1019102022)

22Many people from other people groups and those who are citizens of other kingdoms will gather to worship you.


## Psalms 102:23 (id: 1019102023)

23But now you have caused me to become weak while I am still young; I think that I will not remain alive very long.


## Psalms 102:24 (id: 1019102024)

24I say to you, “My God, do not take me away from the earth now before I become old! You, on the other hand, live forever!


## Psalms 102:25 (id: 1019102025)

25You created the world long ago, and you made the heavens with your own hands.


## Psalms 102:26 (id: 1019102026)

26The earth and the heavens will disappear, but you will remain. They will wear out as clothes wear out. You will get rid of them as people get rid of old clothes, and they will no longer exist.


## Psalms 102:27 (id: 1019102027)

27But you are not like the things that you created because you are always the same; you never die.


## Psalms 102:28 (id: 1019102028)

28Someday our children will live safely in Jerusalem, and their descendants will be protected as they live in your presence.”


## Psalms 103:1 (id: 1019103001)

1A psalm written by David. I tell myself that I should praise Yahweh. I will praise him because he is holy.


## Psalms 103:2 (id: 1019103002)

2I tell myself that I should praise Yahweh and never forget all the kind things he has done for me.


## Psalms 103:3 (id: 1019103003)

3He forgives all my sins, and he heals me from all my diseases;


## Psalms 103:4 (id: 1019103004)

4he keeps me from dying, and he blesses me by faithfully loving me and acting mercifully to me as he promised to do.


## Psalms 103:5 (id: 1019103005)

5He gives me good things during my entire life. He makes me feel young and strong like eagles.


## Psalms 103:6 (id: 1019103006)

6Yahweh judges justly all those who have been treated unfairly.


## Psalms 103:7 (id: 1019103007)

7Long ago he revealed to Moses what he planned to do; he showed to the ancestors of us Israelites the mighty things that he was able to do.


## Psalms 103:8 (id: 1019103008)

8Yahweh acts mercifully and kindly; he does not quickly get angry when we sin; he is always showing us that he faithfully loves us.

9He will not keep rebuking us, and he will not remain angry forever.


## Psalms 103:10 (id: 1019103010)

10He has not punished us for our sins as we deserved.


## Psalms 103:11 (id: 1019103011)

11The skies are very high above the earth, and Yahweh’s faithful love for all those who revere him is just as great.


## Psalms 103:12 (id: 1019103012)

12He has taken away the guilt for our sins and put it as far from us as the east is from the west.


## Psalms 103:13 (id: 1019103013)

13Just as parents act mercifully toward their children, Yahweh is kind to those who revere him.


## Psalms 103:14 (id: 1019103014)

14He knows what our bodies are like; he remembers that he created us from dust and that we therefore quickly fail to do what pleases him .


## Psalms 103:15 (id: 1019103015)

15We humans do not live forever; we are like grass which withers and dies. We are like wild flowers that bloom for a short while;


## Psalms 103:16 (id: 1019103016)

16but then the hot wind blows over them, and they disappear; no one sees them again.


## Psalms 103:17 (id: 1019103017)

17But Yahweh will faithfully keep loving forever all those who revere him, as he promised. He will act fairly to our children and to their children;


## Psalms 103:18 (id: 1019103018)

18he will act that way to all those who obey the covenant he made with them to bless them if they did what he told them to do, to all those who obey what he has commanded.


## Psalms 103:19 (id: 1019103019)

19Yahweh has taken his seat in the heavens where he rules as king; from there he rules over everything.


## Psalms 103:20 (id: 1019103020)

20You angels who belong to Yahweh, praise him! You are powerful creatures who do what he tells you to do; you obey what he commands.


## Psalms 103:21 (id: 1019103021)

21Praise Yahweh, you armies of angels who serve him and do what he desires.


## Psalms 103:22 (id: 1019103022)

22All you things that Yahweh has created, praise him; praise him in every place where he rules, everywhere! I also will praise Yahweh!


## Psalms 104:1 (id: 1019104001)

1I tell myself that I should praise Yahweh. Yahweh, my God, you are very great! As a king has on his royal robes, you have honor and majesty all around you!


## Psalms 104:2 (id: 1019104002)

2You created light and you hide behind it. You spread out the whole sky as someone sets up a tent.


## Psalms 104:3 (id: 1019104003)

3You built your palace on the clouds. You made the clouds to be like chariots to carry you.


## Psalms 104:4 (id: 1019104004)

4You caused the winds to be like your messengers, and flames of fire to be like your servants.


## Psalms 104:5 (id: 1019104005)

5You placed the world firmly on its foundation so that it can never be moved.


## Psalms 104:6 (id: 1019104006)

6Later, you covered the earth with a flood, like a blanket; and the water covered the mountains.


## Psalms 104:7 (id: 1019104007)

7But when you rebuked the water, the oceans receded; your voice spoke like thunder, and then the waters rushed away.


## Psalms 104:8 (id: 1019104008)

8Mountains rose up from the water, and the valleys sank down to the levels that you had determined for them.


## Psalms 104:9 (id: 1019104009)

9Then you set a boundary for the oceans, a boundary that they cannot cross; their water will never again cover the whole earth.


## Psalms 104:10 (id: 1019104010)

10You make springs to pour water into ravines; their water flows down between the mountains.


## Psalms 104:11 (id: 1019104011)

11Those streams provide water for all the animals to drink; the wild donkeys drink the water and are no longer thirsty.


## Psalms 104:12 (id: 1019104012)

12Birds make their nests alongside the streams, and they sing among the branches of the trees.


## Psalms 104:13 (id: 1019104013)

13From the heavens you send rain down on the mountains, and you fill the earth with many good things that you create.


## Psalms 104:14 (id: 1019104014)

14You make grass to grow for the cattle to eat, and you make plants to grow for people. In that way, animals and people get their food from what grows in the soil.


## Psalms 104:15 (id: 1019104015)

15We get grapes to make wine to drink and to make us cheerful; we get olives to make our face shine, and we get grain to make bread to give us strength.


## Psalms 104:16 (id: 1019104016)

16Yahweh, you send plenty of rain to water your trees, the cedar trees that you planted in Lebanon.


## Psalms 104:17 (id: 1019104017)

17Birds make their nests in those trees, and storks make their nests in pine trees.


## Psalms 104:18 (id: 1019104018)

18High up in the mountains the wild goats live, and hyraxes live in the rocks.


## Psalms 104:19 (id: 1019104019)

19Yahweh, you made the moon to indicate the times for our festivals, and you made the sun that knows when to go down.


## Psalms 104:20 (id: 1019104020)

20You bring darkness, and it becomes night when all the animals in the forest prowl around looking for food.


## Psalms 104:21 (id: 1019104021)

21At night the young lions roar as they seek their prey, but they depend on you to give them food.


## Psalms 104:22 (id: 1019104022)

22At dawn, they go back to their dens and lie down.


## Psalms 104:23 (id: 1019104023)

23During the daytime, people go to their work; they work until it is evening.


## Psalms 104:24 (id: 1019104024)

24Yahweh, you have made so many different kinds of things! You were very wise as you made them all. The earth is full of the creatures that you made.


## Psalms 104:25 (id: 1019104025)

25We see the ocean which is very vast! It is full of many kinds of living creatures, big ones and little ones.


## Psalms 104:26 (id: 1019104026)

26We see the ships which sail along! We see the huge sea monster which you made to splash around in the sea.


## Psalms 104:27 (id: 1019104027)

27All of these creatures depend on you to give them the food that they need.


## Psalms 104:28 (id: 1019104028)

28When you give them the food that they need, they gather it. You give them what you have in your hand, and they eat it and are satisfied.


## Psalms 104:29 (id: 1019104029)

29But if you refuse to give food to them, they become terrified. When you cause them to stop breathing, they die; their bodies decay and become soil again.


## Psalms 104:30 (id: 1019104030)

30When you cause newborn creatures to begin to breathe, they start to live; You give new life to all the living creatures on the earth.


## Psalms 104:31 (id: 1019104031)

31May the glory of Yahweh last forever. May he rejoice about all the things that he has created.


## Psalms 104:32 (id: 1019104032)

32He makes the earth shake just by looking at it! By merely touching the mountains he makes them pour out fire and smoke!


## Psalms 104:33 (id: 1019104033)

33I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live. I will praise my God until the day that I die.


## Psalms 104:34 (id: 1019104034)

34May Yahweh be pleased by all these things that I have thought about him because I rejoice about knowing him.


## Psalms 104:35 (id: 1019104035)

35However, may sinners disappear from the earth; may there be no more wicked people! But as for me, I will praise Yahweh! Praise him!


## Psalms 105:1 (id: 1019105001)

1Give thanks to Yahweh; worship him and pray to him. Tell everyone in the world what he has done!


## Psalms 105:2 (id: 1019105002)

2Sing to him; praise him as you sing to him; tell others about his wonderful miracles.


## Psalms 105:3 (id: 1019105003)

3Be proud of Yahweh, who alone is God. You people who worship Yahweh, rejoice!


## Psalms 105:4 (id: 1019105004)

4Ask Yahweh to help you and give you his strength, and always seek to be with him!


## Psalms 105:5 (id: 1019105005)

5(5\-6\) You people who are descendants of God’s servant Abraham, you descendants of Jacob, the people whom God has chosen, think about all the wonderful things that he has done; he performed miracles, and he punished all our enemies.


## Psalms 105:7 (id: 1019105007)

7He is Yahweh, our God. He rules and judges people throughout the earth.


## Psalms 105:8 (id: 1019105008)

8He never forgets the covenant that he made; he made a promise that will last for a thousand generations.


## Psalms 105:9 (id: 1019105009)

9That is the covenant that he made with Abraham, and he repeated that covenant with Isaac.


## Psalms 105:10 (id: 1019105010)

10Later he confirmed it again to Jacob as a covenant for the Israelite people that would last forever.


## Psalms 105:11 (id: 1019105011)

11What he said was, “I will give you the region of Canaan; it will belong to you and your descendants forever.”


## Psalms 105:12 (id: 1019105012)

12He said that to them when there were only a few of them, a tiny group of people who were living in that land like strangers.


## Psalms 105:13 (id: 1019105013)

13They continued to wander from one place to another, from one kingdom to another.


## Psalms 105:14 (id: 1019105014)

14But he did not allow others to oppress them. He warned those kings by saying to them,


## Psalms 105:15 (id: 1019105015)

15“Do not do harm to the people whom I have chosen! Do not harm my prophets!”


## Psalms 105:16 (id: 1019105016)

16He sent a famine to Canaan, and as a result all the people had no food to eat.


## Psalms 105:17 (id: 1019105017)

17So his people went to Egypt, but first he sent someone there. He sent Joseph, who had been sold to be a slave.


## Psalms 105:18 (id: 1019105018)

18Later, while Joseph was in prison in Egypt, they put his legs in shackles that hurt his feet, and they put an iron collar around his neck.


## Psalms 105:19 (id: 1019105019)

19Joseph was in prison until the time the events he predicted came to pass. This was how Yahweh tested Joseph.


## Psalms 105:20 (id: 1019105020)

20The king of Egypt sent servants, who set him free; this ruler released Joseph from prison.


## Psalms 105:21 (id: 1019105021)

21Then he appointed him to take care of everything in the king’s household, to take care of everything that the king possessed.


## Psalms 105:22 (id: 1019105022)

22Joseph was permitted to command the king’s important servants to do anything that Joseph wanted them to do, and even to tell the king’s advisors the things that they should do for the people of Egypt.


## Psalms 105:23 (id: 1019105023)

23Later, Joseph’s father Jacob arrived in Egypt. He lived like a foreigner in the land that belonged to the descendants of Ham.


## Psalms 105:24 (id: 1019105024)

24Years later Yahweh caused the descendants of Jacob to become very numerous. As a result, their enemies, the Egyptians, considered that the Israelites were too strong.


## Psalms 105:25 (id: 1019105025)

25So Yahweh caused the rulers of Egypt to turn against the Israelite people, and they began to oppress his people.


## Psalms 105:26 (id: 1019105026)

26But then Yahweh sent his servant Moses along with Moses’ older brother Aaron, whom Yahweh had also chosen to be his servant.


## Psalms 105:27 (id: 1019105027)

27Those two performed amazing miracles among the people of Egypt in that land where the descendants of Ham lived.


## Psalms 105:28 (id: 1019105028)

28Yahweh sent darkness so that the people of Egypt could not see anything, but the rulers of Egypt refused to obey when Moses and Aaron commanded them to let the Israelite people leave Egypt.


## Psalms 105:29 (id: 1019105029)

29Yahweh caused all the water in Egypt to become blood, and his doing that caused all the fish to die.


## Psalms 105:30 (id: 1019105030)

30Then he caused the land to become full of frogs; the king and his officials even had frogs in their bedrooms.


## Psalms 105:31 (id: 1019105031)

31Then Yahweh commanded that flies come, and swarms of them descended on the people of Egypt, and gnats also swarmed across the whole country.


## Psalms 105:32 (id: 1019105032)

32Yahweh sent rain, rain that became hail that fell upon them, and he sent wild fires that burned throughout their land.


## Psalms 105:33 (id: 1019105033)

33The hail ruined their grapevines and fig trees and shattered all the other trees.


## Psalms 105:34 (id: 1019105034)

34He commanded locusts to come, and hordes of them came; so many came that they could not be counted.


## Psalms 105:35 (id: 1019105035)

35The locusts ate every green plant in the land, ruining all the crops.


## Psalms 105:36 (id: 1019105036)

36Then Yahweh killed the oldest son in every house of the people of Egypt.


## Psalms 105:37 (id: 1019105037)

37Then he brought the Israelite people out from Egypt; they were carrying heavy loads of jewelry made of silver and gold that the people of Egypt had given to them. No one was left behind because of being sick.


## Psalms 105:38 (id: 1019105038)

38The people of Egypt were glad when the Israelite people left because they had become very afraid of the Israelites.


## Psalms 105:39 (id: 1019105039)

39Then Yahweh spread a cloud to cover the Israelites; and at night it became a big fire in the sky to give them light.


## Psalms 105:40 (id: 1019105040)

40Later the Israelites asked for meat to eat, and Yahweh sent flocks of quail to them, and he gave them plenty of manna, food from the sky, each morning.


## Psalms 105:41 (id: 1019105041)

41One day he caused a rock to open up, and water poured out for them to drink; it was like a river flowing in that desert.


## Psalms 105:42 (id: 1019105042)

42He did that because he kept thinking about the sacred promise that he had given to his servant, Abraham.


## Psalms 105:43 (id: 1019105043)

43So his people were joyful as he brought them out from Egypt; these people whom he had chosen were shouting joyfully as they went.


## Psalms 105:44 (id: 1019105044)

44He gave to them the land that belonged to the people groups that lived there in Canaan, and the Israelites took all their wealth.


## Psalms 105:45 (id: 1019105045)

45Yahweh did all these things so that his people would do all the things that he had commanded them to do. Praise Yahweh!


## Psalms 106:1 (id: 1019106001)

1Praise Yahweh! Praise Yahweh because everything he does is good; he faithfully loves us forever as he promised us!


## Psalms 106:2 (id: 1019106002)

2Because Yahweh has done many great things, no one can tell all the great things that Yahweh has done, and no one can praise him enough.


## Psalms 106:3 (id: 1019106003)

3How fortunate are those who act fairly, those who always do what is right.


## Psalms 106:4 (id: 1019106004)

4Yahweh, be kind to me when you help your people; help me when you rescue them.


## Psalms 106:5 (id: 1019106005)

5Allow me to see your people become prosperous again and to see all the people of your nation, Israel, become happy again; allow me to be happy with them! I want to praise you along with all those others who belong to you.


## Psalms 106:6 (id: 1019106006)

6We and our ancestors have sinned; we have done what is wicked and evil.


## Psalms 106:7 (id: 1019106007)

7When our ancestors were in Egypt, they did not pay attention to the wonderful things that Yahweh did; they forgot about the many times that he showed that he faithfully loved them. Instead, when they were at the Sea of Reeds, they rebelled against God, who is greater than any other god.


## Psalms 106:8 (id: 1019106008)

8But he rescued them for the sake of his own reputation so that he could show that he is very powerful.


## Psalms 106:9 (id: 1019106009)

9He rebuked the Sea of Reeds and it became dry, and then while he led our ancestors, they walked through it as though it were as dry as a desert.


## Psalms 106:10 (id: 1019106010)

10In that way he rescued them from the power of their enemies.


## Psalms 106:11 (id: 1019106011)

11Then their enemies were drowned in the water of the Sea of Reeds; not one of them was left.


## Psalms 106:12 (id: 1019106012)

12When that happened, our ancestors believed that Yahweh had truly done for them what he had promised to do, and they sang to praise him.


## Psalms 106:13 (id: 1019106013)

13But they soon forgot what he had done for them; they did things without waiting to find out what Yahweh wanted them to do.


## Psalms 106:14 (id: 1019106014)

14They intensely wanted food like they formerly ate in Egypt. They did evil things to find out whether God would punish them or not.


## Psalms 106:15 (id: 1019106015)

15So he gave them what they requested, but he sent a horrible disease upon them.


## Psalms 106:16 (id: 1019106016)

16Later when some of the men became jealous of Moses and his older brother Aaron, who was dedicated to serve Yahweh by being a priest,


## Psalms 106:17 (id: 1019106017)

17the ground opened up and swallowed Dathan and also buried Abiram and his family.


## Psalms 106:18 (id: 1019106018)

18God sent down from heaven a fire which burned up all the wicked people who supported them.


## Psalms 106:19 (id: 1019106019)

19Then the Israelite leaders made a gold statue of a calf at Mount Sinai and worshiped it.


## Psalms 106:20 (id: 1019106020)

20Instead of worshiping our glorious God, they started to worship a statue of an ox that eats grass!


## Psalms 106:21 (id: 1019106021)

21They forgot about God, who had rescued them by the great miracles that he performed in Egypt.


## Psalms 106:22 (id: 1019106022)

22They forgot about the wonderful things that he did for them in Egypt and the amazing things that he did for them at the Sea of Reeds.


## Psalms 106:23 (id: 1019106023)

23Because of that, God said that he would get rid of the Israelites; but Moses, whom God had chosen to serve him, stood up to persuade God not to do that. As a result, God did not destroy them.


## Psalms 106:24 (id: 1019106024)

24Later, our ancestors refused to enter the beautiful land of Canaan because they did not believe that God would do as he promised and would enable them to take the land from the people who were living there.


## Psalms 106:25 (id: 1019106025)

25They stayed in their tents and grumbled and would not pay attention to what Yahweh said that they should do.


## Psalms 106:26 (id: 1019106026)

26So he solemnly told them that he would cause them to die there in the wilderness,


## Psalms 106:27 (id: 1019106027)

27that he would scatter their descendants among the people of other nations and groups who did not believe in him, and that he would allow them to die in those lands.


## Psalms 106:28 (id: 1019106028)

28Later the Israelite people started to worship the idol of Baal at Mount Peor, and they ate meat that had been sacrificed to Baal and those other lifeless gods.


## Psalms 106:29 (id: 1019106029)

29Yahweh became very angry because of what they had done, so again he sent a terrible disease to attack them.


## Psalms 106:30 (id: 1019106030)

30But Phinehas stood up and punished the ones who had sinned greatly, and as a result the plague ended.


## Psalms 106:31 (id: 1019106031)

31People have remembered that righteous deed that Phinehas did, and in future years people will remember it.


## Psalms 106:32 (id: 1019106032)

32Then at the springs of Meribah our ancestors caused Yahweh to become angry again, and as a result Moses had trouble.


## Psalms 106:33 (id: 1019106033)

33They caused Moses to become very angry, and he said things that were foolish.


## Psalms 106:34 (id: 1019106034)

34Our ancestors did not destroy the other people groups as he told them to do.


## Psalms 106:35 (id: 1019106035)

35Instead, the men took women from those people groups, and they started to do the evil things that those people did.


## Psalms 106:36 (id: 1019106036)

36Our ancestors worshiped the idols of those people, which resulted in their being destroyed.


## Psalms 106:37 (id: 1019106037)

37Some of the Israelites sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons that those idols represented.


## Psalms 106:38 (id: 1019106038)

38They killed children who had done nothing wrong, and offered them as sacrifices to the idols in Canaan. As a result, the land of Canaan was polluted by those murders.


## Psalms 106:39 (id: 1019106039)

39So by their deeds they made it impossible for God to accept them; because they did not faithfully worship only God, they became like women who sleep with other men instead of sleeping only with their husbands.


## Psalms 106:40 (id: 1019106040)

40So Yahweh became very angry with his people; he was completely disgusted with them.


## Psalms 106:41 (id: 1019106041)

41As a result, he allowed people groups who did not believe in him to conquer them, so those who hated our ancestors started to rule over them.


## Psalms 106:42 (id: 1019106042)

42Their enemies oppressed them and completely controlled them.


## Psalms 106:43 (id: 1019106043)

43Many times Yahweh rescued his people, but they continued to rebel against him, and they were finally destroyed because of the sins that they committed.


## Psalms 106:44 (id: 1019106044)

44However, Yahweh always heard them when they cried out to him, and he listened to them when they were distressed.


## Psalms 106:45 (id: 1019106045)

45For their sake, he thought about the covenant that he had made to bless them; because he never stopped loving them very much, he changed his mind about punishing them more.


## Psalms 106:46 (id: 1019106046)

46He caused all those who had taken the Israelites to Babylonia to feel sorry for them.


## Psalms 106:47 (id: 1019106047)

47Yahweh our God, rescue us and bring us back to Israel from among those people groups so that we may thank you and joyfully praise you.


## Psalms 106:48 (id: 1019106048)

48Praise Yahweh, the God whom we Israelites worship, praise him now and forever! All the people should agree! Praise Yahweh!


## Psalms 107:1 (id: 1019107001)

1Give thanks to Yahweh because he always does good things for us! His faithful love for us lasts forever, as he has promised us!


## Psalms 107:2 (id: 1019107002)

2Those whom Yahweh has saved should tell others that he has rescued them from their enemies.


## Psalms 107:3 (id: 1019107003)

3He has gathered those of you who were exiled to many lands; he has gathered you together from the east and the west, from the north and from the south.


## Psalms 107:4 (id: 1019107004)

4Some of those who returned from those countries wandered in the desert; they were lost and had no homes to live in.


## Psalms 107:5 (id: 1019107005)

5They were hungry and thirsty, and they even collapsed in exhaustion.


## Psalms 107:6 (id: 1019107006)

6When they were in trouble, they called out to Yahweh, and he rescued them from being distressed.


## Psalms 107:7 (id: 1019107007)

7He led them along a straight road where they walked safely to cities in Canaan where they could live.


## Psalms 107:8 (id: 1019107008)

8They should praise Yahweh for loving them faithfully and for the wonderful things that he does for people.


## Psalms 107:9 (id: 1019107009)

9He gives thirsty people plenty of water to drink, and he gives hungry people plenty of good things to eat.


## Psalms 107:10 (id: 1019107010)

10Some of them were in very dark prisons; they were prisoners, suffering because of chains fastened to their hands and feet.


## Psalms 107:11 (id: 1019107011)

11They were in prison because they had rebelled against the message of God; they were there because they had despised the advice given by God, who is greater than all other gods.


## Psalms 107:12 (id: 1019107012)

12That is why God made them suffer hardships so that they would no longer be proud; when they got into trouble, there was no one who would help them.


## Psalms 107:13 (id: 1019107013)

13When they were in trouble, they called out to Yahweh, and he rescued them from being distressed.


## Psalms 107:14 (id: 1019107014)

14He broke the chains that were on their hands and feet and brought them out of those very dark prisons.


## Psalms 107:15 (id: 1019107015)

15(15\-16\) He broke down the prison gates that were made of bronze; he cut through the prison bars that were made of iron. They should praise Yahweh for loving them faithfully and for the wonderful things that he does for people.


## Psalms 107:17 (id: 1019107017)

17Some of them foolishly rebelled against God, so they suffered for their sins.


## Psalms 107:18 (id: 1019107018)

18They did not want to eat any food, and they almost died.


## Psalms 107:19 (id: 1019107019)

19When they were in trouble, they called out to Yahweh, and he rescued them from being distressed.


## Psalms 107:20 (id: 1019107020)

20When he commanded that they be healed, they were healed; he saved them from dying.


## Psalms 107:21 (id: 1019107021)

21They should praise Yahweh for loving them faithfully and for the wonderful things that he does for people.


## Psalms 107:22 (id: 1019107022)

22They should give offerings to him to show that they are thankful, and they should sing joyfully about the miracles that he has performed.


## Psalms 107:23 (id: 1019107023)

23Some of them sailed in ships; they were selling things in cities far away.


## Psalms 107:24 (id: 1019107024)

24As they were sailing, they also saw the miracles that Yahweh performed, the wonderful things that he did when they were on very deep seas.


## Psalms 107:25 (id: 1019107025)

25He gave orders to the winds, and they became strong and stirred up high waves.


## Psalms 107:26 (id: 1019107026)

26The ships in which they were sailing were tossed high in the air, and then they sank into the troughs between the high waves; then the sailors were terrified at the danger.


## Psalms 107:27 (id: 1019107027)

27They stumbled about and staggered like drunken men, and they did not know what to do.


## Psalms 107:28 (id: 1019107028)

28When they were in trouble, they called out to Yahweh, and he rescued them from being distressed.


## Psalms 107:29 (id: 1019107029)

29He calmed the storm and he stilled the waves.


## Psalms 107:30 (id: 1019107030)

30They were very glad when it became calm; and Yahweh brought them safely into a harbor as they wished.


## Psalms 107:31 (id: 1019107031)

31They should praise Yahweh for loving them faithfully and for the wonderful things that he does for people.


## Psalms 107:32 (id: 1019107032)

32They should praise him among the Israelite people when they have gathered together, and they should praise him in front of the leaders of the country.


## Psalms 107:33 (id: 1019107033)

33Sometimes Yahweh causes rivers to become dry, with the result that the land becomes a wilderness, and springs of water become dry land.


## Psalms 107:34 (id: 1019107034)

34Sometimes he causes land that has produced lots of crops to become salty wastelands, with the result that they do not produce crops. He does that because the people who live there are very wicked.


## Psalms 107:35 (id: 1019107035)

35But sometimes he causes pools of water to appear in deserts, and he causes springs to flow in very dry ground.


## Psalms 107:36 (id: 1019107036)

36He brings hungry people into that land, to live there and to build cities there.


## Psalms 107:37 (id: 1019107037)

37They plant seeds in their fields, and they plant grapevines that produce large crops of grapes.


## Psalms 107:38 (id: 1019107038)

38He blesses the people, and the women give birth to many children, and they have large herds of cattle.


## Psalms 107:39 (id: 1019107039)

39When the number of people became smaller and they were humiliated by their enemies by being oppressed and caused to suffer,


## Psalms 107:40 (id: 1019107040)

40Yahweh shows contempt for the leaders who oppress them, and makes them to wander in a wilderness where there are no roads.


## Psalms 107:41 (id: 1019107041)

41But he rescues poor people from being in misery and causes their families to increase in number like flocks of sheep.


## Psalms 107:42 (id: 1019107042)

42People who live rightly see God do these things, and they rejoice; wicked people hear about these things, too, but they have nothing to say against Yahweh in reply.


## Psalms 107:43 (id: 1019107043)

43Those who are wise should think carefully about these things; they should consider all the things that Yahweh has done to show that he faithfully loves them.


## Psalms 108:1 (id: 1019108001)

1A psalm written by David; God, I am very confident in you. I will sing to praise you. It is an honor to wake up and praise you.


## Psalms 108:2 (id: 1019108002)

2I will arise before the sun rises, and I will praise you while I play my harp and my lyre.


## Psalms 108:3 (id: 1019108003)

3I prayed, “Yahweh, I will thank you among all the people groups; I will sing to praise you among the nations


## Psalms 108:4 (id: 1019108004)

4because your faithful love for us reaches up to the heavens, and you are as faithful in keeping your promises as the clouds are high above the earth.


## Psalms 108:5 (id: 1019108005)

5Yahweh, show in the heavens that you are very great! Show your glory to people all over the earth!


## Psalms 108:6 (id: 1019108006)

6Answer our prayers and, by your power help us to defeat our enemies so that we, the people whom you love, may be saved.”


## Psalms 108:7 (id: 1019108007)

7Yahweh answered our prayers and spoke from his temple, saying, “Because I have conquered your enemies, I will joyfully divide the city of Shechem, and I will distribute among my people the land in the Valley of Succoth.


## Psalms 108:8 (id: 1019108008)

8The region of Gilead is mine; the people of the tribe of Manasseh are mine; and the tribe of Judah is like my scepter.


## Psalms 108:9 (id: 1019108009)

9The region of Moab is like my washbasin; I throw my sandal over the region of Edom to show that it belongs to me; I shout triumphantly because I have defeated the people of the region of Philistia.”


## Psalms 108:10 (id: 1019108010)

10Because we want to attack the people of Edom, who will lead my army to their capital city that has strong walls around it?


## Psalms 108:11 (id: 1019108011)

11God, we do not want you to abandon us; we want you to go with us when our army marches out to fight our enemies.


## Psalms 108:12 (id: 1019108012)

12We need you to help us when we fight against our enemies because the help that humans can give us is worthless.


## Psalms 108:13 (id: 1019108013)

13But with you helping us, we shall win; you will enable us to defeat our enemies.


## Psalms 109:1 (id: 1019109001)

1A psalm written by David for the choir director. God, you are the one whom I praise, so please answer my prayer


## Psalms 109:2 (id: 1019109002)

2because wicked people slander me and tell lies about me.


## Psalms 109:3 (id: 1019109003)

3They are constantly saying that they hate me, and they harm me for no reason.


## Psalms 109:4 (id: 1019109004)

4I show them that I love them and that I pray for them, but instead of being kind to me, they say that I have done evil things.


## Psalms 109:5 (id: 1019109005)

5In return for my doing good things for them and loving them, they do evil things to me and hate me.


## Psalms 109:6 (id: 1019109006)

6So appoint a wicked judge who will judge my enemy, and bring in one of his enemies who will stand up and accuse him.


## Psalms 109:7 (id: 1019109007)

7When the trial ends, cause the judge to declare that he is guilty and cause even his plea for mercy to be considered a sin.


## Psalms 109:8 (id: 1019109008)

8Then cause him to die soon; bring someone else to take over his work.


## Psalms 109:9 (id: 1019109009)

9Cause his children not to have a father anymore, and cause his wife to become a widow.


## Psalms 109:10 (id: 1019109010)

10Cause his children to leave the ruined homes that they have been living in and to wander around begging for food.


## Psalms 109:11 (id: 1019109011)

11Cause all the people to whom he owed money to seize his property; cause strangers to take away everything that he worked to acquire.


## Psalms 109:12 (id: 1019109012)

12Make sure that no one acts with any loyalty toward his memory for the sake of your covenant; make sure that no one pities his children.


## Psalms 109:13 (id: 1019109013)

13Cause all his children to die, so that no one will live to carry on his name.


## Psalms 109:14 (id: 1019109014)

14Yahweh, remember and do not forgive his ancestors for the evil things that they did, and do not even forgive the sins that his mother committed.


## Psalms 109:15 (id: 1019109015)

15Think about his sins continually, but cause everyone living to completely forget who he was.


## Psalms 109:16 (id: 1019109016)

16I pray these things because that man, my enemy, never acted toward anyone as your covenant says we must; he persecuted poor and needy people and even killed helpless people.


## Psalms 109:17 (id: 1019109017)

17He liked to curse people. So those terrible things that he requested to happen to others—cause them to happen to him! He did not want to bless others, so make sure that no one blesses him!


## Psalms 109:18 (id: 1019109018)

18He often cursed other people, also; cause the terrible things that he wanted to happen to others to happen to him and enter his body as water does, as olive oil soaks into a person’s bones when it is rubbed on his skin.


## Psalms 109:19 (id: 1019109019)

19Cause those terrible things to cling to him like his clothes and be around him like the belt that he wears every day.


## Psalms 109:20 (id: 1019109020)

20Yahweh, I wish that you will punish all my enemies that way, those who say evil things about me.


## Psalms 109:21 (id: 1019109021)

21But Yahweh, my God, do good things for me in order that I may honor you; rescue me from my enemies because you faithfully love me as you promised.


## Psalms 109:22 (id: 1019109022)

22I request you to do this because I am poor and needy and my inner being is full of pain.


## Psalms 109:23 (id: 1019109023)

23I think that my time to remain alive is as short as an evening shadow that will soon disappear. I will be blown away as a locust is blown by the wind.


## Psalms 109:24 (id: 1019109024)

24My knees are weak because I have fasted very often, and my body has become very thin.


## Psalms 109:25 (id: 1019109025)

25The people who accuse me make fun of me; when they see me, they insult me by shaking their heads at me.


## Psalms 109:26 (id: 1019109026)

26Yahweh, my God, help me! Because you faithfully love me, rescue me!


## Psalms 109:27 (id: 1019109027)

27When you save me, cause my enemies to know that you are the one who has done it!


## Psalms 109:28 (id: 1019109028)

28They may curse me, but I ask that you bless me. Cause those who persecute me to be defeated and disgraced, but cause me to be glad!


## Psalms 109:29 (id: 1019109029)

29Cause those who accuse me to be completely disgraced; cause other people to see that they are disgraced as easily as they see the clothes that they wear!


## Psalms 109:30 (id: 1019109030)

30But I will thank Yahweh very much; I will praise him when I am among the crowd of people who are worshiping him.


## Psalms 109:31 (id: 1019109031)

31I will do that because he defends poor people like me and because he saves us from those who have said that we must die.


## Psalms 110:1 (id: 1019110001)

1A psalm written by David. Yahweh said to my lord the king, “Sit here, close to me, in the place of highest honor until I completely defeat your enemies and make them like a stool for your feet!”


## Psalms 110:2 (id: 1019110002)

2Yahweh will extend your power as king from Jerusalem to other lands; you will rule over all your enemies.


## Psalms 110:3 (id: 1019110003)

3On the day that you lead your armies into battle, many of your people will volunteer to join your army. Your youthful strength will act for you like the dew that waters the earth early in the morning.”


## Psalms 110:4 (id: 1019110004)

4Yahweh has made a solemn promise and he will never change his mind; he has said to the king, “You will be a priest forever like Melchizedek.”


## Psalms 110:5 (id: 1019110005)

5The Lord stands at your right side; when he becomes angry, he will defeat many kings.

## Psalms 111:4 (id: 1019111004)

4He has done wonderful things that people will always remember; Yahweh always acts kindly and mercifully.


## Psalms 111:5 (id: 1019111005)

5He provides food for those who have an awesome respect for him; he never forgets the covenant that he made with our ancestors.

6By enabling his people to capture the lands that belonged to other people groups, he has shown to us, his people, that he is very powerful.

7He does everything fairly, as he has promised us, and we can depend on him to help us when he commands us to do things.

2the land of Judah became the place where people worshiped God; and Israel became the land that he ruled over.


## Psalms 114:3 (id: 1019114003)

4But their idols are only statues made of silver and gold, things that humans have made.

2He listens to me, so I will call out to him all during my life.


## Psalms 116:3 (id: 1019116003)

3Everything around me caused me to think that I would die; I was very afraid that I would die and go to the place where dead people are. I was very distressed and afraid.


## Psalms 116:4 (id: 1019116004)

4But then I called out to Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh, I plead with you to save me!”

7I must encourage myself because Yahweh has done very good things for me.

9So here on the earth where people are still alive, I live, knowing that Yahweh is directing me.

13I will offer to him a cup of wine to thank him for saving me.
