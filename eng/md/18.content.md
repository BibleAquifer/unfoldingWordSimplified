## Job 1:1 (id: 1018001001)

1In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. He was a man of complete integrity. He respected God and so he avoided doing evil things.


## Job 1:2 (id: 1018001002)

2Now Job had seven sons and three daughters.


## Job 1:3 (id: 1018001003)

3He owned 7, 000 sheep, 3, 000 camels, 1, 000 oxen, and 500 donkeys. He also had many servants. Job was richer than anyone else who lived in the area east of the Jordan River.


## Job 1:4 (id: 1018001004)

4Job’s sons often held feasts in their homes. Whenever any of them held a feast, he would invite all of his brothers and sisters to share the meal with him.


## Job 1:5 (id: 1018001005)

5After all of the sons had each held a feast, Job would gather his children together. He would ask Yahweh to cleanse them from any action they might have committed during their feasting that would have made them unacceptable to him. He would get up early in the morning, kill animals, and burn them on the altar {as sacrifices}, one for each {of his children}. {For} Job {always said}, “Perhaps my children have sinned by saying something evil about God in their thoughts. {If they have, I need to ask God to forgive them.}” Job did this after each time his sons had all hosted feasts.


## Job 1:6 (id: 1018001006)

6One day the angels came and gathered together in front of Yahweh, and Satan came too.


## Job 1:7 (id: 1018001007)

7Yahweh asked Satan, “Where have you just come from?” Satan replied, “I have come from the earth, where I was traveling around {to see what was happening}.”


## Job 1:8 (id: 1018001008)

8Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you noticed Job, who worships me? I mention him because no one else on earth has such complete integrity as he does. He respects me and so he refuses to do anything evil.”


## Job 1:9 (id: 1018001009)

9Satan replied to Yahweh, “Job only worships you because of what you have done for him.


## Job 1:10 (id: 1018001010)

10You have always protected him, his family, and everything he owns. You make him succeed in whatever work he does. As a result, he has built very large herds of livestock.


## Job 1:11 (id: 1018001011)

11But if you attack what he owns and take it away, he will certainly curse you in front of everyone.”


## Job 1:12 (id: 1018001012)

12Yahweh replied to Satan, “All right, I permit you to take away everything that he has. But do not harm him in his own body.” Satan {agreed and then} left Yahweh {in order to carry out his attack on Job}.


## Job 1:13 (id: 1018001013)

13One day after that, Job’s sons and daughters were attending a feast at the home of the oldest brother.


## Job 1:14 (id: 1018001014)

14{While they were doing that,} a messenger arrived at Job’s home. He told Job, “Your oxen were plowing the fields and your donkeys were grazing nearby.


## Job 1:15 (id: 1018001015)

15But a group of men from the Sheba people group came and attacked us. They killed all of your servants who were working in the fields. They took away all the oxen and donkeys! I am the only one who has escaped to come and tell you what happened.”


## Job 1:16 (id: 1018001016)

16While he was still talking to Job, another messenger arrived. He said to Job, “Lightning from the sky struck and killed all the sheep and all the men who were taking care of them! I am the only one who has escaped to come and tell you what happened.”


## Job 1:17 (id: 1018001017)

17While he was still talking to Job, a third messenger arrived. He said to Job, “Three groups of robbers from the region of Chaldea came and attacked us. They stole all the camels and killed all the men who were taking care of them. I am the only one who has escaped to come and tell you what happened.”


## Job 1:18 (id: 1018001018)

18While he was still talking to Job, a fourth messenger arrived. He said to Job: “Your sons and daughters were feasting in the home of their oldest brother.


## Job 1:19 (id: 1018001019)

19Suddenly a very strong wind came from the desert and struck the house. The house collapsed on your sons and daughters and killed them all! I am the only one who has escaped to come and tell you what happened.”


## Job 1:20 (id: 1018001020)

20Then Job stood up and tore his robe and shaved his head {because he was very sad}. Then he lay down on the ground to worship God.


## Job 1:21 (id: 1018001021)

21He said, “When I was born, I was wearing no clothes. When I die, I will not take any clothes with me. It is Yahweh who gave me everything that I possessed, and it is Yahweh who has taken it all away. I find no fault with Yahweh.


## Job 1:22 (id: 1018001022)

22So in spite of all the things that had happened to him, Job did not sin by saying that what God had done was wrong.


## Job 2:1 (id: 1018002001)

1On another day, the angels came again and gathered together in front of Yahweh. Satan also came again.


## Job 2:2 (id: 1018002002)

2Yahweh asked Satan, “Where have you come from {this time}?” Satan replied, “I have come from the earth, where I was traveling around {to see what was happening}.”


## Job 2:3 (id: 1018002003)

3Yahweh asked Satan, “Have you noticed that Job continues to worship me? I mention him again because no one else on earth has such complete integrity as he does. He respects me, and so he refuses to do anything evil. He still does this even though you persuaded me to {permit you to} attack him for no reason.”


## Job 2:4 (id: 1018002004)

4Satan replied to Yahweh, “Job still worships you because he is glad you destroyed his herds and family rather than destroying him. People will give up everything they have in order to save their own lives.


## Job 2:5 (id: 1018002005)

5But if you harm his body, he will certainly curse you in front of everyone!”


## Job 2:6 (id: 1018002006)

6Yahweh replied to Satan, “All right, I permit you to harm his body. But you must leave him alive.”


## Job 2:7 (id: 1018002007)

7Satan {agreed and he} left. He went and caused Job to suffer from very painful boils all over his body.


## Job 2:8 (id: 1018002008)

8Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped the boils on his skin. He sat down in a pile of ashes {outside the city}.


## Job 2:9 (id: 1018002009)

9His wife said to him, “You should not still be loyal to God! You should curse God and then go ahead and die.”


## Job 2:10 (id: 1018002010)

10But Job replied, “You are talking the way people talk who do not know God. We should be willing to receive whatever God sends us.” So in spite of all the things that had happened to him, Job did not sin by saying that what God had done was wrong.


## Job 2:11 (id: 1018002011)

11Job had some good and wise friends. One of them was Eliphaz from the town of Teman. Another was Bildad from the Shuhite people group. A third friend was Zophar from the town of Naamah. These men heard about the terrible things that had happened to Job. So they each left their homes and went together to visit Job to comfort him sincerely.


## Job 2:12 (id: 1018002012)

12But when they saw Job from a distance, they almost did not recognize him. They wailed loudly, they all tore their clothing, and they threw dust into the air that settled on their heads. {They did these things to demonstrate how sorry they were for Job.}


## Job 2:13 (id: 1018002013)

13Then they sat on the ground with Job for seven days. {During that time} none of them said anything to him, out of respect for how greatly he was suffering.


## Job 3:1 (id: 1018003001)

1At the end of those seven days, Job started speaking. He cursed the day when he was born.


## Job 3:2 (id: 1018003002)

2He said,


## Job 3:3 (id: 1018003003)

3“I wish that the day of my birth had never existed! {I feel the same way about} the night when my mother conceived me.


## Job 3:4 (id: 1018003004)

4I wish that there would only be darkness on that day {so that it would not even be a day}. I wish that God in heaven would not care about that day and so not make the sun shine on it.


## Job 3:5 (id: 1018003005)

5I wish that that day were only darkness, with clouds blocking out the sunlight and many other things also making it very dark.


## Job 3:6 (id: 1018003006)

6I wish that the moon and stars would not shine on the night when my mother conceived me. I wish that the day of my birth was not part of any month. Indeed, I wish that it was not a day in the year at all.


## Job 3:7 (id: 1018003007)

7I mean it—I wish that no mother would ever again bear a child on that date. I wish that no one would ever again rejoice {over a child’s birth} on that date.


## Job 3:8 (id: 1018003008)

8There are magicians who know how to agitate the chaos monster. I want them to curse the day of my birth!


## Job 3:9 (id: 1018003009)

9I wish that the stars that shone early in the morning of that day would never shine again. I wish that it would never become light on that day. I wish that not even the first rays of the rising sun would appear on that day.


## Job 3:10 (id: 1018003010)

10I wish that day did not exist, because my mother gave birth to me on that day, and because I became alive, I have now experienced all these terrible things.


## Job 3:11 (id: 1018003011)

11I wish that I had died right after my mother gave birth to me! I wish I had stopped breathing after being alive for only a short time!


## Job 3:12 (id: 1018003012)

12I wish that my mother had never held me on her lap and nursed me!


## Job 3:13 (id: 1018003013)

13If I had died shortly after my mother gave birth to me, I would now be resting peacefully among all the other people who had died.


## Job 3:14 (id: 1018003014)

14{I would be resting} with great kings and their advisers. They built beautiful tombs on spacious grounds {and are now resting in them}.


## Job 3:15 (id: 1018003015)

15Or {I would be resting} with princes who owned great quantities of gold and silver.


## Job 3:16 (id: 1018003016)

16I wish that I had died in my mother’s womb and never lived for even a moment. Then people would have buried me privately.


## Job 3:17 (id: 1018003017)

17After wicked people die, they do not cause any more trouble. That allows the people whom they were oppressing to rest.


## Job 3:18 (id: 1018003018)

18Those who were prisoners all rest peacefully {after they die}. They no longer have slave drivers ordering them around.


## Job 3:19 (id: 1018003019)

19Everyone, whether rich or poor, goes to the realm of the dead. Those who were slaves no longer have to obey their masters.


## Job 3:20 (id: 1018003020)

20God should not allow those who are suffering greatly like me to continue to remain alive! God should not allow those who are very miserable to live!


## Job 3:21 (id: 1018003021)

21They long to die, but they do not die. They desire to die more than people desire to find buried treasure.


## Job 3:22 (id: 1018003022)

22{God should not give life in the first place} to people who are very happy when they finally die!


## Job 3:23 (id: 1018003023)

23God should not give life to people if he is going to keep them from knowing what to do or from understanding what is really happening to them!


## Job 3:24 (id: 1018003024)

24I am wishing that I were dead because now I cry so much that I cannot eat. I just keep groaning loudly.


## Job 3:25 (id: 1018003025)

25There were things that I always worried might happen to me. Those things have now happened!


## Job 3:26 (id: 1018003026)

26I really have no peace of mind at all. My troubles keep disturbing me.”


## Job 4:1 (id: 1018004001)

1Then Eliphaz, Job’s friend from the town of Teman, replied to what Job had said. Eliphaz said,


## Job 4:2 (id: 1018004002)

2“Will you please allow me to say something to you? I feel compelled to speak to you.


## Job 4:3 (id: 1018004003)

3You yourself have given good advice to many people. You have encouraged people who were discouraged.


## Job 4:4 (id: 1018004004)

4When people were struggling, you were able to say the right thing to help them. You enabled them to be brave again.


## Job 4:5 (id: 1018004005)

5But now that you yourself are suffering, you have become discouraged. You are not facing your troubles bravely {as you have helped others to do}.


## Job 4:6 (id: 1018004006)

6You should be confident because you honor God. You should be hopeful because you conduct yourself with integrity.


## Job 4:7 (id: 1018004007)

7Think about this: God does not destroy people who are innocent! No, God never kills people who are doing what is right!


## Job 4:8 (id: 1018004008)

8I know from experience that this is true: When people plan to do bad things to others, those bad things happen to them instead.


## Job 4:9 (id: 1018004009)

9God becomes very angry with them {because of the wrong things they plan to do}, and so God commands that they will die, and they do die.


## Job 4:10 (id: 1018004010)

10Wicked people may boast and threaten, but God destroys them.


## Job 4:11 (id: 1018004011)

11Those wicked people will have nothing in the end, like lions that starve to death because God keeps them from catching any prey. Different relatives will have to take care of the children of those wicked people, as if they were lion cubs whose parents caught no prey and they had to separate from each other in order to search for food.


## Job 4:12 (id: 1018004012)

12I once heard a message that someone came and whispered to me.


## Job 4:13 (id: 1018004013)

13One night I fell deeply asleep and had a dream that made me very perplexed.


## Job 4:14 (id: 1018004014)

14I was so scared that I started to shake all over.


## Job 4:15 (id: 1018004015)

15Then a spirit slid into view right in front of me! This caused the hair on the back of my neck to stand straight up.


## Job 4:16 (id: 1018004016)

16The spirit stopped there, but I could not see what it really looked like. However, I knew that there was some being in front of me. At first it did not speak, but then it said,


## Job 4:17 (id: 1018004017)

17‘No human being can be more righteous than God. No person can be better than his Creator.


## Job 4:18 (id: 1018004018)

18Consider this: God recognizes that even his own angels may not always do what is right. If they do not act wisely, he corrects them.


## Job 4:19 (id: 1018004019)

19So God is even more careful to discipline human beings, knowing how very frail they are.


## Job 4:20 (id: 1018004020)

20{Humans are so fragile that} they can be here today and gone tomorrow. {And humans are so insignificant that} a person can die, never to return to earth, and no one will even notice.


## Job 4:21 (id: 1018004021)

21Humans are {fragile,} like tents that collapse if someone pulls up their stakes. And they may live their whole lives on earth without ever learning to be wise.’


## Job 5:1 (id: 1018005001)

1If you ask someone to judge between you and God, no one will agree to do that for you. Not even an angel would have the authority or wisdom to judge your case.


## Job 5:2 (id: 1018005002)

2People who do not respect God get angry with God {instead of considering how they have sinned}. Naïve people resent God {when they do not get what they think they deserve}. {Their anger and resentment lead them to disobey God, so that} God punishes them severely and even kills them. So respect God and do not be naïve!


## Job 5:3 (id: 1018005003)

3I have seen foolish people who seemed to be successful. But immediately I recognized that they would not prosper for long.


## Job 5:4 (id: 1018005004)

4Their children are never safe. They always lose to their opponents in court because no one defends them.


## Job 5:5 (id: 1018005005)

5People who do not respect God are not able to harvest the crops that they plant. Poor people come and claim the grain—right to the edges of the field! Yes, poor people see their crops and are glad to have them.


## Job 5:6 (id: 1018005006)

6After all, trouble does not come out of nowhere.


## Job 5:7 (id: 1018005007)

7No, people cause trouble for themselves throughout their lives. This is as certain as the fact that sparks shoot up from a fire.


## Job 5:8 (id: 1018005008)

8If I were suffering as you are, I would ask God for help and trust God to help me.


## Job 5:9 (id: 1018005009)

9God does great things that we can not understand. We can not even count the marvelous things that God does.


## Job 5:10 (id: 1018005010)

10God is the one who sends rain onto the earth so that it waters our fields.


## Job 5:11 (id: 1018005011)

11God defends people who are humble. He gives widows safe places to live.


## Job 5:12 (id: 1018005012)

12God keeps devious people from being able to do what they plan.


## Job 5:13 (id: 1018005013)

13When people try cleverly to make others suffer, God makes this cause suffering for them instead. When people try to trick others, God shows that it is a trick before it can fool the others.


## Job 5:14 (id: 1018005014)

14God keeps wicked people from knowing how to fulfill their plans. It is as if the wicked people are always in the dark, even during the day, and they need to feel around with their hands to try to find where to go.


## Job 5:15 (id: 1018005015)

15When powerful people threaten or accuse weak people, God rescues the weak people. He keeps the powerful people from harming them.


## Job 5:16 (id: 1018005016)

16{Because they know that God will help them,} poor people can confidently expect that good things will happen to them. God proves that they are innocent when people accuse them falsely.


## Job 5:17 (id: 1018005017)

17Consider this: Anyone whom God corrects is better off because of it. So you should be thankful that God is disciplining you.


## Job 5:18 (id: 1018005018)

18You should be thankful because God allows people to suffer {in order to correct them} and then he restores them.


## Job 5:19 (id: 1018005019)

19Whenever you are in trouble, God will keep rescuing you. God will keep bad things from happening to you.


## Job 5:20 (id: 1018005020)

20When there is little food to eat, God will not allow you to starve to death. When there is war, God will not allow your enemies to kill you.


## Job 5:21 (id: 1018005021)

21God will protect you when people say bad things about you. God will protect you from things that could badly harm you.


## Job 5:22 (id: 1018005022)

22You will not worry about things like that or about not having enough to eat. You will not be afraid that wild animals will hurt you,


## Job 5:23 (id: 1018005023)

23because you will be confident that those wild animals will not attack you. You will not have big rocks in your fields that make plowing difficult.


## Job 5:24 (id: 1018005024)

24You will know that things will go well for you in your home. When you check on your animals, you will see that they are all there.


## Job 5:25 (id: 1018005025)

25You will be certain that you will have many descendants. They will be as numerous as blades of grass.


## Job 5:26 (id: 1018005026)

26You will live a long life, like grain that grows to become fully ripe before it is harvested.


## Job 5:27 (id: 1018005027)

27I can assure you that my friends and I have thought carefully about these things. We know that they are true, so please pay careful attention to what I have said! You also will realize that it is true.”


## Job 6:1 (id: 1018006001)

1Then Job replied to Eliphaz and the others. He said,


## Job 6:2 (id: 1018006002)

2“If I could put all my troubles and misery on a scale and weigh them,


## Job 6:3 (id: 1018006003)

3they would certainly be heavier than all the sand along the ocean shores. That is why I spoke very rashly about the day when I was born.


## Job 6:4 (id: 1018006004)

4It is as if Almighty God had shot me with arrows. It is as if those arrows had poison on their tips and that poison had gone into my spirit. The things that God has done to me are like soldiers lined up to attack me.


## Job 6:5 (id: 1018006005)

5Just as a wild donkey does not complain by braying when it has plenty of grass to eat, and an ox does not complain by bellowing when it has food to eat, I would not complain if you were really helping me.


## Job 6:6 (id: 1018006006)

6People use salt to help them eat food that has little taste. People do that with the white of an egg, for example. I have been saying how I feel in order to help me deal with my situation.


## Job 6:7 (id: 1018006007)

7But regarding food itself, I actually do not want to eat at all, because my troubles are making me too upset to eat.


## Job 6:8 (id: 1018006008)

8I wish that God would do for me what I have asked of him:


## Job 6:9 (id: 1018006009)

9I wish that God would agree to let me die! God is certainly able to end my life.


## Job 6:10 (id: 1018006010)

10If he did that, I would be comforted: I would know that in spite of the unrelenting pain I had suffered, I would still always have obeyed God’s commands.


## Job 6:11 (id: 1018006011)

11I do not have the strength to endure until these troubles are over. I have nothing to look forward to, so I do not want to live any longer!


## Job 6:12 (id: 1018006012)

12I am not strong like stone, my body is not sturdy like bronze, so I will not be able to endure these troubles for a long time.


## Job 6:13 (id: 1018006013)

13I am no longer able to help myself. My troubles are keeping me from doing that.


## Job 6:14 (id: 1018006014)

14When a man has many troubles, his friends should be kind to him, even if he stops honoring Almighty God.


## Job 6:15 (id: 1018006015)

15But you, my friends, have not helped me. You are like streams in the wilderness that travelers cannot depend on, because they leave their channels empty in the dry season.


## Job 6:16 (id: 1018006016)

16These streams are full of water when the melting ice and snow make them overflow,


## Job 6:17 (id: 1018006017)

17but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing in those streams, and the channels dry up.


## Job 6:18 (id: 1018006018)

18Merchant caravans turn off the road to search for water. {However, there is no water in those stream beds, so} the merchants die in the desert.


## Job 6:19 (id: 1018006019)

19The men in those caravans searched for some water because they were sure that they would find some.


## Job 6:20 (id: 1018006020)

20They were very disappointed, because they had been sure that they would find water. They traveled a long distance to the stream bed, but there was no water in it.


## Job 6:21 (id: 1018006021)

21Similarly, you three have not helped me at all! You have seen that terrible things have happened to me, and you are not helping me, because you are afraid that God might do similar things to you.


## Job 6:22 (id: 1018006022)

22{After I lost all my wealth,} I did not ask any of you to give me money. I did not plead with any of you to spend some of your money to help me.


## Job 6:23 (id: 1018006023)

23I never asked any of you to rescue me from my enemies. No, I did not ask you to save me from people who were oppressing me.


## Job 6:24 (id: 1018006024)

24Answer me now, and then I will be quiet; tell me what wrong things I have done!


## Job 6:25 (id: 1018006025)

25I would be willing to listen to what you had to say, even if it were painful, as long as it was helpful. But though you are trying to correct me, you are not really helping me at all.


## Job 6:26 (id: 1018006026)

26I am a man who has nothing to hope for, but you try to correct me, and you think what I say is as useless as the wind!


## Job 6:27 (id: 1018006027)

27In fact, you are treating me as callously as if you were gambling for an orphan or arguing over the price of a friend you were selling into slavery!


## Job 6:28 (id: 1018006028)

28Please look at me! I will not lie while I am talking straight to you.


## Job 6:29 (id: 1018006029)

29Please stop saying that I have sinned! Stop criticizing me unfairly! You should realize that I have not done anything wrong.


## Job 6:30 (id: 1018006030)

30You must not think that I am lying! I know what is right to say and what is wrong to say.


## Job 7:1 (id: 1018007001)

1“Life is very difficult for all of us on this earth! Like manual laborers, our days are long and hard.


## Job 7:2 (id: 1018007002)

2We are like slaves who keep wanting to be in the cool of evening. We are like workers who have to wait to be paid.


## Job 7:3 (id: 1018007003)

3Like a slave, I am enduring a time when it feels useless to be alive. I have been experiencing many miserable nights.


## Job 7:4 (id: 1018007004)

4When I go to bed I say, ‘I hope I will be able to sleep for a long time!’ But I never really get to sleep. I am restless right through to the morning.


## Job 7:5 (id: 1018007005)

5My body is covered with maggots and dirt; pus oozes out of my open sores.


## Job 7:6 (id: 1018007006)

6I am running out of days faster than a shuttle releases yarn into a loom, and I have no reason to hope that my life will end well.


## Job 7:7 (id: 1018007007)

7God, remember that my life will soon end. {I do not think that} I will ever be happy again.


## Job 7:8 (id: 1018007008)

8God, you see me now, but {after I die,} you will not see me anymore. You may look for me then, but {you will not find me, because} I will not exist.


## Job 7:9 (id: 1018007009)

9Just as a cloud never appears in the sky again once it fades, so when people die and go to the place where dead people are, they never return to earth.


## Job 7:10 (id: 1018007010)

10They never return and live in their houses again.


## Job 7:11 (id: 1018007011)

11So I will say everything I want to say. I will speak because I am so upset. I will complain because I am so bitter.


## Job 7:12 (id: 1018007012)

12God, you do not need to watch what I am doing so closely! I am not a dangerous sea monster!


## Job 7:13 (id: 1018007013)

13Sometimes I think that if I could just go to sleep, I would stop suffering; my pain would be less while I was sleeping.


## Job 7:14 (id: 1018007014)

14But then you make me have terrible nightmares!


## Job 7:15 (id: 1018007015)

15And I wish someone would kill me by choking me so that I would not have to stay alive {and suffer so much}.


## Job 7:16 (id: 1018007016)

16I hate being alive {and suffering so much}! I do not want to live any longer! Stop afflicting me, because I will only be alive for a short time.


## Job 7:17 (id: 1018007017)

17We human beings are not very important! You should not think that we are so important that you need to pay attention to what we do.


## Job 7:18 (id: 1018007018)

18You do not need to check every morning to see what we are doing! You do not need to evaluate us at every moment!


## Job 7:19 (id: 1018007019)

19I wish you would stop watching me and leave me alone for at least a little while!


## Job 7:20 (id: 1018007020)

20You watch me constantly, but if I sin, that certainly does not harm you! I feel as if I am your target and that you are shooting at me! You act as if I am bothering you all the time!


## Job 7:21 (id: 1018007021)

21If I have done wrong things, you could just forgive me. I am going to die soon. When I do, then if you decide you want us to be friends, it will be too late, because I will be dead.”


## Job 8:1 (id: 1018008001)

1Then Bildad, Job’s friend from the Shuhite people group, responded to Job. He said,


## Job 8:2 (id: 1018008002)

2“Job, you should not continue to talk like this. You are saying a lot of things, but they are not sensible.


## Job 8:3 (id: 1018008003)

3God always does things fairly. Yes, Shaddai always does what is right.


## Job 8:4 (id: 1018008004)

4Your children sinned against God. This is evident, because God has punished them for the evil things they did.


## Job 8:5 (id: 1018008005)

5But as for you, you should pray to God. Yes, you should ask Shaddai to help you.


## Job 8:6 (id: 1018008006)

6If you are genuinely good, then God will certainly do something good for you. He will give you back the abundant prosperity that good people have.


## Job 8:7 (id: 1018008007)

7God would make you so wealthy later in life that it would seem as if you were not very prosperous before!


## Job 8:8 (id: 1018008008)

8You should really consider the wise teachings of the people who lived before us. Yes, you should think about what our ancestors learned about life.


## Job 8:9 (id: 1018008009)

9I advise you to consider the wisdom of our ancestors because we have only been alive for a short time and we know very little. This is because our time here on the earth is very short, like a shadow that appears briefly and then goes away.


## Job 8:10 (id: 1018008010)

10But if you consider the wisdom of our ancestors, you will learn useful things. Indeed, you will learn very profound things.


## Job 8:11 (id: 1018008011)

11Papyrus certainly does not grow away from marshland. No, reeds certainly cannot grow where there is no water.


## Job 8:12 (id: 1018008012)

12If their water dries up while they are blossoming, they wither, while plants that do have water keep flourishing.


## Job 8:13 (id: 1018008013)

13People who do not pay attention to God are like those reeds. Such people hope for good things, but they do not get them.


## Job 8:14 (id: 1018008014)

14Godless people confidently expect good things to happen to them, but those things do not happen. Godless people trust certain other people to help them, but those others prove unreliable.


## Job 8:15 (id: 1018008015)

15Godless people think they are secure because they are wealthy, but ultimately they can not rely on their wealth for security. When they begin to fail despite their wealth, they try to preserve their status, but they fail anyway.


## Job 8:16 (id: 1018008016)

16Godless people are like plants that formerly flourished in abundant sunshine, whose branches once spread out over the ground.


## Job 8:17 (id: 1018008017)

17Godless people are like plants whose roots once twisted securely around piles of stones and clung tightly to rocks.


## Job 8:18 (id: 1018008018)

18But a person can still pull a plant completely out of the ground even if it is that healthy and securely rooted. Then it will be as if the plant was never there in the first place. People who do not pay attention to God will perish just as completely.


## Job 8:19 (id: 1018008019)

19So people who do not pay attention to God will be sad in the end. Other people will come and take their places.


## Job 8:20 (id: 1018008020)

20So I tell you, Job, that God will help you if you do what is right. But God will not help you if you do what is wrong.


## Job 8:21 (id: 1018008021)

21God can still make you happy, yes, very happy.


## Job 8:22 (id: 1018008022)

22{When God blesses you,} everyone who opposed you will be very ashamed. God will completely destroy wicked people.”


## Job 9:1 (id: 1018009001)

1Then Job replied to Bildad and the others. He said,


## Job 9:2 (id: 1018009002)

2“I certainly know that what you have said is true. But a person can not prove that he has done the right thing {and that God should not punish him}.


## Job 9:3 (id: 1018009003)

3If someone wanted to argue with God about that, God would ask him many questions and that person would not be able to answer any of them!


## Job 9:4 (id: 1018009004)

4God thinks very deeply and he is very powerful. No one who has tried to argue against him has ever been able to win.


## Job 9:5 (id: 1018009005)

5God moves mountains {in earthquakes} without anyone knowing in advance what he is going to do. God knocks down mountains when he is angry.


## Job 9:6 (id: 1018009006)

6God causes earthquakes far below the surface of the earth that shake the ground and make it move.


## Job 9:7 (id: 1018009007)

7On some days, God makes it so cloudy that people can not see the sun in the sky. On some nights, God makes it so cloudy that people can not see the stars shining.


## Job 9:8 (id: 1018009008)

8God created the sky all by himself. God defeated the forces of chaos {so that he could make an orderly universe}.


## Job 9:9 (id: 1018009009)

9God arranged the stars in the sky to make constellations such as the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades. God arranged stars into many other constellations as well.


## Job 9:10 (id: 1018009010)

10God does amazing things that people can not understand. God does more marvelous things than people are able to count.


## Job 9:11 (id: 1018009011)

11If God passed by where I was, I would not be able to see him. Yes, he might be going by, but I would not notice him.


## Job 9:12 (id: 1018009012)

12If God wants to take something away, no one can stop him from doing that. No one can require God to defend what he is doing.


## Job 9:13 (id: 1018009013)

13God would continue to be angry {even if someone tried to calm him down}. {No one can oppose him;} he {even} defeated the forces of Rahab, the great sea monster.


## Job 9:14 (id: 1018009014)

14So I could hardly think of the right words to say in order to argue a case against God!


## Job 9:15 (id: 1018009015)

15Even if I were innocent, I would not be able to argue a case against him. All I could do would be to ask God, as my judge, to be merciful to me.


## Job 9:16 (id: 1018009016)

16Even if he agreed to hear my case, I would not believe that he was genuinely considering my arguments.


## Job 9:17 (id: 1018009017)

17He keeps causing troubles that batter me. He hurts me many times for no good reason.


## Job 9:18 (id: 1018009018)

18He causes me to suffer all the time. It is as if he will not even let me get my breath again {before he causes the next disaster}.


## Job 9:19 (id: 1018009019)

19Suppose I did make a case against him. And suppose the winner would be the one who was stronger. Then he would win, because he is far stronger than I am. And it would not matter who was right, since no one could make him obey what a judge decided.


## Job 9:20 (id: 1018009020)

20Even though I was innocent, he would find grounds in what I said to punish me. Even though I had not done anything wrong, he would still decide, based on what I said, that I was guilty.


## Job 9:21 (id: 1018009021)

21I have not done anything wrong, {but that does not matter anymore because} I do not care what happens to me. I do not care whether I live or die.


## Job 9:22 (id: 1018009022)

22God punishes everyone the same way. As I have been saying, God destroys everyone whether they have done wrong or not.


## Job 9:23 (id: 1018009023)

23When people experience disaster and it causes them to die suddenly, God laughs when he sees them suffer, even if they are innocent.


## Job 9:24 (id: 1018009024)

24God has allowed wicked people to control what happens to everyone else. It is as though God has caused judges not to be able to judge fairly. If it is not God who has done that, who, then, has done it?


## Job 9:25 (id: 1018009025)

25I am approaching the end of my life more quickly than a messenger runs to bring news. it is as if the days of my life are running away from me. Good things do not happen to me.


## Job 9:26 (id: 1018009026)

26My life is going by very rapidly, as fast as a sailing boat made from reeds, as fast as an eagle swooping down to seize an animal.


## Job 9:27 (id: 1018009027)

27If I decide that I will just forget what I am complaining about, if I decide to stop looking sad and try to be cheerful,


## Job 9:28 (id: 1018009028)

28I still become afraid again because I know that God does not consider me innocent and so I think that he will punish me.


## Job 9:29 (id: 1018009029)

29He will condemn me anyway, so why should I keep trying in vain to defend myself?


## Job 9:30 (id: 1018009030)

30If I washed my body with pure water from melted snow and cleansed my hands with strong soap {to show how innocent I am},


## Job 9:31 (id: 1018009031)

31God would just throw me into a filthy pit {to show how guilty he considers me to be}. My body would become so dirty that it would be as if my own clothes did not want to be on it!


## Job 9:32 (id: 1018009032)

32God is not a human, as I am, so I could not refute him to prove that I am innocent if we went together to have a trial in a courtroom.


## Job 9:33 (id: 1018009033)

33There is no one to mediate, no one who has authority over both of us.


## Job 9:34 (id: 1018009034)

34There is no one who could keep God from causing me to suffer, who could keep God from doing terrifying things that frighten me.


## Job 9:35 (id: 1018009035)

35{If someone could protect me and judge between us,} I would declare that I am innocent without being afraid of God. But I can not do that now.


## Job 10:1 (id: 1018010001)

1I am tired of living, so I will freely express everything I want to complain about {without worrying about what God will do to me}. Yes, I will say exactly how unhappy I am.


## Job 10:2 (id: 1018010002)

2I will say to God, ‘If you are going to punish me, you should tell me what I have done wrong!’


## Job 10:3 (id: 1018010003)

3You seem to think that it is all right to harm me and to abandon me, whom you created. But at the same time, you seem pleased to allow wicked people to do the things that they plan to do!


## Job 10:4 (id: 1018010004)

4Certainly you know and understand more than what people can see with their eyes! {So you should understand my true motives and know that I am innocent.}


## Job 10:5 (id: 1018010005)

5You do not live for only a short time as people do!


## Job 10:6 (id: 1018010006)

6So you do not need to act as if you would run out of time if you did not discover all of my sins right away!


## Job 10:7 (id: 1018010007)

7{You do not need to work hard to discover any sins that I may have committed, because} you know that I am not guilty. And there is no one who could help me get away from you {if you decided you should punish me}.


## Job 10:8 (id: 1018010008)

8You personally created every single part of me. So it is not right for you to destroy someone whom you created yourself.


## Job 10:9 (id: 1018010009)

9Please recall how you made me! You molded me the way people mold objects out of clay. If you destroy me, I will crumble into dust {and you will lose your marvelous creative work}.


## Job 10:10 (id: 1018010010)

10You made me through a careful process, the way people carefully make cheese out of milk.


## Job 10:11 (id: 1018010011)

11You attached my bones together with tendons, and then you covered them with flesh inside my skin.


## Job 10:12 (id: 1018010012)

12You are the one who made me alive. {It seemed that} you were faithfully taking care of me. {It seemed that} you were protecting me.


## Job 10:13 (id: 1018010013)

13But you kept secret what you were planning to do to me. I am certain that you were planning to do these things to me!


## Job 10:14 (id: 1018010014)

14You were watching me to see if I would sin so that you could punish me for sinning.


## Job 10:15 (id: 1018010015)

15If I am a wicked man, then I hope that terrible things will happen to me. But even if I am a good man, I must still act ashamed because you are punishing me as if I had sinned.


## Job 10:16 (id: 1018010016)

16If I did act like the good man that I am, you would {conclude that you should punish me further and you would} hunt for me the way a lion hunts for some animal to kill. {When you caught me,} you would do even more things to harm me greatly.


## Job 10:17 (id: 1018010017)

17You would claim that I had committed even more sins. You would become even more angry with me. You would keep punishing me in new ways.


## Job 10:18 (id: 1018010018)

18God, you should not have allowed my mother to give birth to me! I wish that I had died at birth! Yes, I wish that my parents had never shown me to anyone.


## Job 10:19 (id: 1018010019)

19I wish that I had never even existed! I wish that I had died at birth so that people had buried me right away.


## Job 10:20 (id: 1018010020)

20I am not going to live very much longer! So please leave me alone and let me have a little peace.


## Job 10:21 (id: 1018010021)

21{Let me have some peace now because} soon I will go to the place from which I will never return. In that place {where dead people go} it is always gloomy. Yes, it is very dark.


## Job 10:22 (id: 1018010022)

22Yes, in that place it is very dark, the way it is in deep shadow. Things are very chaotic there. Even the small light that is there is like darkness.’”


## Job 11:1 (id: 1018011001)

1Then Zophar, Job’s friend from the town of Naamah, responded to Job. He said,


## Job 11:2 (id: 1018011002)

2“I would like to respond to the long speech that you have just given. You talk a lot about how innocent you are, but that does not mean that you truly are innocent.


## Job 11:3 (id: 1018011003)

3You have boasted that you are innocent, and I need to talk back in response. You have said disrespectful things about God. I need to tell you that you should be ashamed!


## Job 11:4 (id: 1018011004)

4I need to correct you because you have told God, ‘I believe the right things, and you know that I have done the right things.’


## Job 11:5 (id: 1018011005)

5If only God would speak and say something to correct you!


## Job 11:6 (id: 1018011006)

6If only God would tell you the secrets that he knows because he is so wise! {You need to realize that} God knows far more than you do. If you could understand as God does, you would realize that God is punishing you less than you deserve!


## Job 11:7 (id: 1018011007)

7You will never be able to understand God by thinking hard about him. No, you will never be able to find out everything about Shaddai.


## Job 11:8 (id: 1018011008)

8God’s wisdom is so much greater than ours, it is as if it is higher than the sky. So there is nothing you can do to understand it all. It is as if God’s wisdom is deeper below the earth than the place where dead people go. So it is impossible for you to know it all.


## Job 11:9 (id: 1018011009)

9There is so much to know about God that it is as if that knowledge is longer than the earth and wider than the ocean.


## Job 11:10 (id: 1018011010)

10If God wants to arrest you and put you on trial, no one can stop him from doing that.


## Job 11:11 (id: 1018011011)

11{God is a trustworthy judge} because he knows which people have bad character. When God sees people doing wicked things, he punishes them.


## Job 11:12 (id: 1018011012)

12Some people simply have no understanding. They will become wise when humans start having wild donkeys as babies{—that is, never!}


## Job 11:13 (id: 1018011013)

13Job, I urge you to repent humbly and pray sincerely to God.


## Job 11:14 (id: 1018011014)

14If you have been doing evil things, stop doing them. If you do nothing wrong in any part of your life,


## Job 11:15 (id: 1018011015)

15then you will be able to act as a person who is not ashamed of anything. You will be strong, and you will not be afraid of anything.


## Job 11:16 (id: 1018011016)

16You will not be afraid, because you will forget all the bad things that happened to you. They will all be gone, like the water that flows away down a river.


## Job 11:17 (id: 1018011017)

17Your life will be happy again. It will be as if the sun were shining on you as brightly as it shines at mid\-day. You have had many troubles, but they will end, just as night ends when the sun rises.


## Job 11:18 (id: 1018011018)

18You will feel safe because you will be confident that good things will happen to you. You will think about your life and realize that you can go to bed and sleep peacefully.


## Job 11:19 (id: 1018011019)

19You will lie down to sleep and nothing will scare you. Many people will come and ask you to be kind to them.


## Job 11:20 (id: 1018011020)

20But God will punish wicked people by making them die. They will not be able to escape from God’s punishment. They will hope to live, but they will die anyway.”


## Job 12:1 (id: 1018012001)

1Then Job replied to Zophar and the others. He said,


## Job 12:2 (id: 1018012002)

2“You are speaking as if you were the people to whom everyone should listen. You seem to believe that you are the only wise people who are now alive.


## Job 12:3 (id: 1018012003)

3But I have as much good sense as you do. I am just as wise as you are. People certainly know, in general, the things that you have said.


## Job 12:4 (id: 1018012004)

4Before, when I prayed to God for help, God would help me. But now{, because God is not helping me in my suffering,} other people laugh at me. I am righteous and I honor God, but they laugh at me!


## Job 12:5 (id: 1018012005)

5People like you who have no troubles think that others are suffering because of their sins. You think that God is punishing us and that is why we are suffering.


## Job 12:6 (id: 1018012006)

6Meanwhile, bandits get rich by robbing people. Those who defiantly disobey God live peacefully. Such people believe that God cannot stop them from doing what they want to do.


## Job 12:7 (id: 1018012007)

7But if the wild animals could speak, and if you asked them {what they know about God}, they would tell you {that God is responsible when someone suffers as I am suffering}. If the birds could speak, and if you asked them {the same question}, they would tell you {the same thing}.


## Job 12:8 (id: 1018012008)

8If the ground could talk, and if you asked it about God, or if fish could talk and you asked them, they too would tell you that God is responsible when people suffer.


## Job 12:9 (id: 1018012009)

9All of them certainly know that it is Yahweh himself who has caused me to suffer.


## Job 12:10 (id: 1018012010)

10He controls whether all living creatures live or die, including whether any person dies or continues to live.


## Job 12:11 (id: 1018012011)

11We decide whether our food is good or bad by tasting it. In the same way, we think carefully about what we hear people say in order to decide whether it is good or bad advice. {I have listened carefully to you, and I have decided that you are giving me bad advice!}


## Job 12:12 (id: 1018012012)

12Older people have usually become wise. Because they have lived a long time, they have learned many things.


## Job 12:13 (id: 1018012013)

13God himself is wise and very powerful. He has good sense and he understands everything.


## Job 12:14 (id: 1018012014)

14Indeed, if God tears something down, no one can build it back up again. If God puts someone in prison, no one can enable that person to escape.


## Job 12:15 (id: 1018012015)

15Yes, God is so powerful that if he prevents rain from falling, then the water on the earth dries up. If God causes a lot of rain to fall, then water floods onto the land.


## Job 12:16 (id: 1018012016)

16God is the one who is truly strong and wise. He does not let anyone get away with doing wrong or with convincing others to do wrong.


## Job 12:17 (id: 1018012017)

17{God is so powerful that} he can remove royal advisors from their positions, and he can cause judges to become fools.

18God can take away the ruling authority that kings have and make those kings become slaves instead.


## Job 12:19 (id: 1018012019)

19God can remove priests from their positions and take the power away from those who have long ruled others.


## Job 12:20 (id: 1018012020)

20God can cause trusted counselors not to know what to say, and he can cause wise elders no longer to have good sense.


## Job 12:21 (id: 1018012021)

21God can cause princes to lose the respect of others, and he can cause those who are powerful to become weak.


## Job 12:22 (id: 1018012022)

22God can enable people to understand things that are very difficult to understand.


## Job 12:23 (id: 1018012023)

23God causes some nations to become very great, but later he destroys them. God enables some nations to enlarge their territory greatly, but later he allows others to conquer them and take their people away as prisoners.


## Job 12:24 (id: 1018012024)

24He causes some human rulers to become foolish. As a result, they try one thing after another without success, as if they were lost in a desert without roads.


## Job 12:25 (id: 1018012025)

25It is as if they were trying to feel their way in complete darkness. It is as if they were staggering around drunk.”


## Job 13:1 (id: 1018013001)

1“I can assure you, my friends, that I already know everything that you have been telling me. Yes, I have heard and understood all that you have said.


## Job 13:2 (id: 1018013002)

2I know everything that you know. I do not know less than you do.


## Job 13:3 (id: 1018013003)

3But I would like to speak with Almighty God{, not with you}. I would like to convince him {that I am innocent}.


## Job 13:4 (id: 1018013004)

4As for you, you are telling so many lies about me that other people can hardly recognize what I am really like. Your advice is so worthless that you are all like doctors who sell people useless medicine.


## Job 13:5 (id: 1018013005)

5I wish that you would just stop talking. Then you would really seem to be wise!


## Job 13:6 (id: 1018013006)

6Please pay attention to what I am telling you!


## Job 13:7 (id: 1018013007)

7You are speaking on God’s behalf, but you are not telling the truth! You are speaking deceptively, but you think that you are helping God!


## Job 13:8 (id: 1018013008)

8You are not being fair to me. Instead, you are acting as if you are God’s lawyers defending him in court!


## Job 13:9 (id: 1018013009)

9If God investigates what you are doing, he will find that you are doing wrong. No, you can not deceive him as you might deceive a human being!


## Job 13:10 (id: 1018013010)

10God would certainly rebuke you when he discovered that you were pretending to be fair but were actually being unfair.


## Job 13:11 (id: 1018013011)

11He would certainly bring the full force of his power against you. That would make you very afraid of him!


## Job 13:12 (id: 1018013012)

12You are quoting traditional sayings, but they have no value in my situation. Your arguments in support of your position are very easy for someone to refute.


## Job 13:13 (id: 1018013013)

13So stop talking to me. Allow me to speak. I do not care what God does to me as a result of what I say.


## Job 13:14 (id: 1018013014)

14I will be risking my life. I will be taking the chance that God will execute me for what I say. But I have good reason to do that.


## Job 13:15 (id: 1018013015)

15Indeed, God might kill me {for starting to argue a case against him}, but I hope that he {would still judge me fairly after I die}. So I am going to defend my behavior to him in person.


## Job 13:16 (id: 1018013016)

16I believe that arguing a case against God will actually help convince God that I am innocent. After all, no wicked person would dare to approach God personally.”


## Job 13:17 (id: 1018013017)

17“God, listen very carefully to what I say. Pay attention to me as I speak.


## Job 13:18 (id: 1018013018)

18Please pay careful attention because I will be defending myself by telling you things I have thought carefully about. I have examined myself, and I am convinced that I am innocent.


## Job 13:19 (id: 1018013019)

19I do not believe that anyone could prove that what I am going to say is false. If I knew that it was false, I would not argue this case. I would accept dying {as my fair punishment}.


## Job 13:20 (id: 1018013020)

20However, I must ask you to stop doing two things to me. Then I will be able to speak with you in person.


## Job 13:21 (id: 1018013021)

21The first thing I ask is that you stop punishing me. The second thing I ask is that you stop scaring me.


## Job 13:22 (id: 1018013022)

22{If you agree to stop punishing me and stop scaring me, then} go ahead and start questioning me, and I will respond. Or allow me to question you first, and then you respond to my questions.


## Job 13:23 (id: 1018013023)

23Tell me what I have done that is wrong. Tell me what sins I have committed. Show me how I have disobeyed you.


## Job 13:24 (id: 1018013024)

24I do not understand why you are avoiding me. I do not understand why you are treating me like your enemy.


## Job 13:25 (id: 1018013025)

25I am as insignificant as a leaf that the wind blows, so you do not need to punish me {as if I were a dangerous criminal}. I am as unimportant as a bit of dry chaff, so you do not need to chase me.


## Job 13:26 (id: 1018013026)

26{From the way I am suffering, it appears that you are punishing me because} you consider that I have done terrible things. It seems that you are punishing me even for the wrong things I did when I was young {and I did not know any better}.


## Job 13:27 (id: 1018013027)

27It seems as if {you are judging me too strictly, as if} you had put chains on my feet {to keep me from going anywhere}. It feels as if you are watching everything that I do very closely. It is as if you will only let me do a few specific things.


## Job 13:28 (id: 1018013028)

28{But you do not need to watch me so closely.} I am a mere human being with a body that is as fragile as rotten wood that is falling apart, as fragile a piece of cloth that the larvae of moths are eating.


## Job 14:1 (id: 1018014001)

1Human beings live only a short time, and during that time they experience much trouble.


## Job 14:2 (id: 1018014002)

2People live brief lives, like flowers that appear quickly but then wither and fall to the ground. Yes, people’s lives are temporary, like shadows that appear only for a short time.


## Job 14:3 (id: 1018014003)

3God, you do not need to watch fragile humans so carefully. You do not need to judge everything that I do.


## Job 14:4 (id: 1018014004)

4No one can make something that is acceptable to God out of something that is not acceptable to him.


## Job 14:5 (id: 1018014005)

5You have decided how many days each human life will last. Yes, you have decided how many months each person will live. No one can live any longer than the time you have decided. Because this is true,


## Job 14:6 (id: 1018014006)

6please stop watching people so closely. Give them relief so that they can live out their brief lives in peace.


## Job 14:7 (id: 1018014007)

7Now even after people cut a tree down, it is possible for it to start growing again and make new branches.


## Job 14:8 (id: 1018014008)

8Its roots in the ground may be very old, and its stump may be decaying,


## Job 14:9 (id: 1018014009)

9but when rain falls on it, it may revive and send up shoots just as a young plant does.


## Job 14:10 (id: 1018014010)

10But even the strongest people die. They grow weak and stop breathing, and then they are gone forever.


## Job 14:11 (id: 1018014011)

11Just as water evaporates from a lake, and just as a riverbed dries up,


## Job 14:12 (id: 1018014012)

12so people die and do not become alive again. Until the heavens do not exist any longer, people who die will not come back to life. No, no one will be able to make them alive again.


## Job 14:13 (id: 1018014013)

13I wish that you, God, would put me safely in the place where dead people go and forget about me. That way I would not suffer any more until you were no longer angry with me. I wish that you would decide how much time I need to spend there and then come and rescue me from that place.


## Job 14:14 (id: 1018014014)

14I do not believe that we humans live again after we die. If I knew that I would live again, I would wait patiently throughout this difficult life. I would know that after I died, things would become different for me.


## Job 14:15 (id: 1018014015)

15{After I had been in the place where dead people go for the time you had determined,} you would call for me, and I would answer you. You would be eager to see me, one of the creatures that you had made.


## Job 14:16 (id: 1018014016)

16Yes, then you would protect me wherever I went, and you would not be watching to see whether I sinned or not.


## Job 14:17 (id: 1018014017)

17You would forgive the things I had done wrong. Yes, it would be as if I had not done them at all.


## Job 14:18 (id: 1018014018)

18But just as mountains erode away and rocks tumble down slopes,


## Job 14:19 (id: 1018014019)

19just as water wears away stones and floods wash away soil, so you make all people die, even though they hope to keep living.


## Job 14:20 (id: 1018014020)

20You make us age the whole time we are living, and then we die. Yes, you make our faces show that we are old and about to die, and then you make us go to the place where dead people go.


## Job 14:21 (id: 1018014021)

21When we die, we do not know whether our children will grow up and do things that will cause other people to honor them. If they do shameful things instead, we do not know that either.


## Job 14:22 (id: 1018014022)

22When we die, we feel sorry for ourselves, but no one else feels sorry for us. Yes, we grieve for ourselves, but no one else grieves for us.”


## Job 15:1 (id: 1018015001)

1Then Eliphaz, Job’s friend from the town of Teman, replied to what Job had said. Eliphaz told him,


## Job 15:2 (id: 1018015002)

2“If you were truly wise, you would not have said such useless things. You have said a lot, but it has all been insignificant.


## Job 15:3 (id: 1018015003)

3You should not be saying things that do not benefit anyone. No, you should not speak things that are not helpful.


## Job 15:4 (id: 1018015004)

4You are actually encouraging others not to respect God. Yes, you are discouraging people from honoring him.


## Job 15:5 (id: 1018015005)

5You are wicked, and that is why you say what you do. You are talking in the way that deceptive people talk.


## Job 15:6 (id: 1018015006)

6Everything that you say shows that God should punish you. It is not necessary for me to prove that.


## Job 15:7 (id: 1018015007)

7{You should not think that you know so much} You were not the first person whom God created. God did not make you when he first formed the world.


## Job 15:8 (id: 1018015008)

8You do not listen as God makes his plans. You should not think that you are the only person who is wise.


## Job 15:9 (id: 1018015009)

9We know everything that you know. We understand everything that you understand.


## Job 15:10 (id: 1018015010)

10My friends and I are saying the same things that old, wise people say, people who were born before your father was.


## Job 15:11 (id: 1018015011)

11God wants to comfort you and speak gently to you, but you do not appreciate that.


## Job 15:12 (id: 1018015012)

12You should not be allowing yourself to become so emotional. No, you should not be allowing yourself to lose your temper.


## Job 15:13 (id: 1018015013)

13You have become angry with God, and so you are saying harsh things against him.


## Job 15:14 (id: 1018015014)

14No human being can be sinless. No one on this earth can be completely righteous.


## Job 15:15 (id: 1018015015)

15God does not even trust his own angels {to do the right thing every time}. He does not consider the heavens to be completely pure.


## Job 15:16 (id: 1018015016)

16So God certainly does not consider people to be pure who commit terrible wrongs, who do evil deeds as often as they drink water.


## Job 15:17 (id: 1018015017)

17Job, I want to explain {why you are experiencing so much suffering}. Please listen to me. I have learned many things, and I want to explain them to you.


## Job 15:18 (id: 1018015018)

18These are things that wise people have passed down from their ancestors. These wise people have declared all these things openly.


## Job 15:19 (id: 1018015019)

19God gave the land {of Edom} exclusively to my wise ancestors. No one came from another country and caused them to think wrongly about God.


## Job 15:20 (id: 1018015020)

20Wicked people suffer great pain the whole time that they are alive. God has determined that this will happen constantly to those who oppress others.


## Job 15:21 (id: 1018015021)

21Wicked people constantly experience terrible things. They may become wealthy, but they will lose that wealth.


## Job 15:22 (id: 1018015022)

22Wicked people lose hope that their troubles will ever end. They are always afraid that they are going to die violently.


## Job 15:23 (id: 1018015023)

23They have to go and search for food to eat. They do not know where to find it. They know that they will certainly experience disasters soon.


## Job 15:24 (id: 1018015024)

24Wicked people are always afraid that bad things will happen to them. Their fear keeps them from taking actions that might protect them, as if an opposing king had defeated them in a battle {and they had become helpless}.


## Job 15:25 (id: 1018015025)

25These things happen to wicked people because they oppose God. They think they are strong enough to defeat Shaddai.


## Job 15:26 (id: 1018015026)

26Wicked people stubbornly oppose God as if they had a strong shield to protect themselves against God.


## Job 15:27 (id: 1018015027)

27But they are so fat that they would not be able to fight!


## Job 15:28 (id: 1018015028)

28Wicked people have to live in cities that others have deserted. They live in homes that others have abandoned. Those homes are about to collapse into a pile of ruins.


## Job 15:29 (id: 1018015029)

29Few wicked people become rich, and those who do become rich do not stay rich for very long. No, they do not acquire great wealth.


## Job 15:30 (id: 1018015030)

30Wicked people will always be in trouble. They will be like trees whose branches burn up. When God gives the command, they will die.


## Job 15:31 (id: 1018015031)

31Wicked people are often foolish and want to get things that are actually worthless. In the end, all they have are those worthless things.


## Job 15:32 (id: 1018015032)

32While they are still young, they will die. They are like branches that have broken off a tree and dried up.


## Job 15:33 (id: 1018015033)

33Wicked people are like vines whose grapes fall off before they are ripe. They are like olive trees whose blossoms fall off before they produce any fruit.


## Job 15:34 (id: 1018015034)

34Surely wicked people will not have any descendants. Those who took money from bribes will not have any money left in the end.


## Job 15:35 (id: 1018015035)

35They plan to cause trouble and to do evil things. They continually think of ways to deceive other people.”


## Job 16:1 (id: 1018016001)

1Then Job replied to Eliphaz and the others. He said,


## Job 16:2 (id: 1018016002)

2“I have heard many things like that before. All of you, instead of helping me, are only causing me to feel more miserable.


## Job 16:3 (id: 1018016003)

3I wish that you would stop saying these things that are not helping me. Eliphaz, I do not understand why you feel that you must keep replying to me.


## Job 16:4 (id: 1018016004)

4I could say the same things that you are saying if you were the ones suffering instead of me. I could make great speeches to criticize you, and I could shake my head at you {to ridicule you}.


## Job 16:5 (id: 1018016005)

5I would think that I was encouraging you by what I said. Yes, I would think that I was relieving you by speaking with you


## Job 16:6 (id: 1018016006)

6But as it is, if I talk, I continue to suffer just as much, and if I do not talk, that does not reduce my suffering either.


## Job 16:7 (id: 1018016007)

7But now {I will speak to God}. God, you have taken away all my strength, and you have killed all of my children.


## Job 16:8 (id: 1018016008)

8You have made me sick, and I have lost a lot of weight, and people think that shows that I am a sinner. They see how thin I am, and they think that proves that I am guilty.


## Job 16:9 (id: 1018016009)

9God is so angry with me that he has attacked me and hurt me. Now he is moving his teeth back and forth because he is still so angry with me. He is watching me closely {to see how he can attack me again}.


## Job 16:10 (id: 1018016010)

10People look at me with their mouths wide open in order to humiliate me. They hit me in the face because they think I have done wrong. They crowd around me to threaten me.


## Job 16:11 (id: 1018016011)

11God has allowed people who do not honor him to mistreat me. He has allowed wicked people to do whatever they want to me.


## Job 16:12 (id: 1018016012)

12Previously, I was living peacefully, but then God caused great trouble for me. It is as if he grabbed my neck and shook me to pieces. It is as if he set me up as a target


## Job 16:13 (id: 1018016013)

13and people were surrounding me and shooting arrows at me. It is as if those arrows cut open my kidneys and caused the gall from my liver to spill onto the ground. God is not having any mercy on me at all!


## Job 16:14 (id: 1018016014)

14It is as if I were a wall that God was breaking down in many places. It is as if God were rushing at me like a soldier who was attacking his enemy.


## Job 16:15 (id: 1018016015)

15{I am grieving so deeply that} it is as if I have sewn rough mourning cloth right onto my skin! I feel weak and humiliated.


## Job 16:16 (id: 1018016016)

16My face is red because I have cried so much. I have dark circles around my eyes because I have not been sleeping well.


## Job 16:17 (id: 1018016017)

17All this has happened to me even though I have not violently harmed anyone and even though I pray sincerely to God.


## Job 16:18 (id: 1018016018)

18I feel as if I am the victim of a violent crime, and I want people to show concern about what has happened to me. I do not want anyone to stop me while I am demanding that God act justly toward me.


## Job 16:19 (id: 1018016019)

19But even now, I know that there is someone in heaven who will testify for me. He will confirm that what I have done is right.


## Job 16:20 (id: 1018016020)

20This person in heaven is my friend, and he will plead with God for me. {At the same time, I will also plead with God so earnestly} that I will weep.


## Job 16:21 (id: 1018016021)

21My friend will plead with God for me in heaven the same way one person pleads for another person here on earth.


## Job 16:22 (id: 1018016022)

22{I want God to treat me justly now, while there is still time,} because within a few years I will die.


## Job 17:1 (id: 1018017001)

1My time to live is almost over. I have no strength left. I am just about to die.


## Job 17:2 (id: 1018017002)

2The people who are around me are continually making fun of me. I have to watch them taunt me.


## Job 17:3 (id: 1018017003)

3“God, even though you would be trying my case, please also guarantee to yourself that I will appear in court and behave as a defendant should. There is certainly no one else who will do that for me.


## Job 17:4 (id: 1018017004)

4My friends will not vouch for me, because you have prevented them from understanding that I am innocent. Nevertheless, you will not prove them right by declaring me guilty.


## Job 17:5 (id: 1018017005)

5{I know that you will treat me justly because you make sure that people act justly. {For example,} you punish people who give false testimony against their neighbors in exchange for a bribe. You make their whole families suffer if they do that.


## Job 17:6 (id: 1018017006)

6But because God is punishing me, people use my name to mean someone who was formerly prosperous but who experienced disaster because he was wicked. People even spit in my face {to insult me}.


## Job 17:7 (id: 1018017007)

7Because I am very sad, it has become hard for me to see. My whole body has become so thin that it is as if I am not even here.


## Job 17:8 (id: 1018017008)

8When people who are truly righteous see what has happened to me, it shocks them. It makes them want to punish people who really disobey God.


## Job 17:9 (id: 1018017009)

9Those who are truly righteous will continue to do what is right, and those who are innocent will continue to become stronger.


## Job 17:10 (id: 1018017010)

10But as for you friends of mine, we could continue talking, but I do not think that I will conclude that even one of you is wise.


## Job 17:11 (id: 1018017011)

11My time to live has almost ended. I have not been able to do the things that I planned to do. I can no longer hope that the things I most desired will happen.


## Job 17:12 (id: 1018017012)

12My friends say that the troubles I am experiencing are actually a good thing {because God is using the troubles to correct me}. My friends say that because my troubles have become so bad, that means they must nearly be over.


## Job 17:13 (id: 1018017013)

13Suppose the only home I could hope to have was the place where dead people go. Suppose I were going to stay in that dark place.


## Job 17:14 (id: 1018017014)

14Suppose I considered the grave to be my family home, and suppose I considered the worms that live in graves to be my family.


## Job 17:15 (id: 1018017015)

15Then that would show that I truly do not have good things to hope for. Everyone would recognize that I was not really hoping for anything.


## Job 17:16 (id: 1018017016)

16It would be as if everything I hoped for were going to the place where dead people go. Yes, it would be as if people were burying the things I have hoped for with me in a grave.”


## Job 18:1 (id: 1018018001)

1Then Bildad, Job’s friend from the Shuhite people group, responded to Job. He said,


## Job 18:2 (id: 1018018002)

2“Please stop talking! If you would stop talking and listen, we could tell you something.


## Job 18:3 (id: 1018018003)

3You seem to think that we are as stupid as cattle.


## Job 18:4 (id: 1018018004)

4But by being so angry, you are only hurting yourself. You seem to think that everyone should abandon the earth because life on earth is no longer worth living for anyone after what has happened to you. You seem to think that there should be a great earthquake {as a sign of what an awful thing has happened to you}.


## Job 18:5 (id: 1018018005)

5But actually, what has happened to you is not momentous. Wicked people are bound to lose their prosperity. They will not continue to enjoy happiness.


## Job 18:6 (id: 1018018006)

6It will be as if the light went out in the tent in which they were living, so that they could not enjoy living there.


## Job 18:7 (id: 1018018007)

7Wicked people become weaker {because of the troubles they cause for themselves}. They try to take advantage of other people, but they hurt themselves instead.


## Job 18:8 (id: 1018018008)

8Yes, it is as if they walk into a net that they do not realize is there or fall into a pit that someone has concealed as a trap.


## Job 18:9 (id: 1018018009)

9It is as if their feet get caught in a trap that does not let them go.


## Job 18:10 (id: 1018018010)

10It is as if a loop of rope that someone has hidden on the ground springs up and seizes them when they walk onto it.


## Job 18:11 (id: 1018018011)

11Everywhere they go, things cause them to be terrified. It is as if those things are pursuing them and biting at their heels.


## Job 18:12 (id: 1018018012)

12They will become weak, as if they did not have enough food to eat. They will always be at risk of disaster.


## Job 18:13 (id: 1018018013)

13Diseases will spread all over their skin. Yes, a horrible disease will cause their bodies to decay.


## Job 18:14 (id: 1018018014)

14They have a secure life, but it ends suddenly. They die without being able to do anything to save their lives.


## Job 18:15 (id: 1018018015)

15Then all of their possessions will belong to other people. Wicked people will have nothing left, as if God had burned up everything they had by making burning stones fall on it.


## Job 18:16 (id: 1018018016)

16They will be lifeless, like trees whose roots have dried up and whose branches have all withered.


## Job 18:17 (id: 1018018017)

17No one on the earth will remember them anymore. No, no one anywhere in the world will recall what they were like.


## Job 18:18 (id: 1018018018)

18Suddenly wicked people will die and no longer be alive. They will no longer be able to live in this world.


## Job 18:19 (id: 1018018019)

19They will have no children or grandchildren living in their people group after they die. They will have no descendants living where they previously lived.


## Job 18:20 (id: 1018018020)

20Anyone who hears about what happened to them will be shocked.


## Job 18:21 (id: 1018018021)

21This is certainly what happens to unrighteous people. Yes, this is what happens to people who do not honor God.”


## Job 19:1 (id: 1018019001)

1Then Job replied to Bildad and the others. He said,


## Job 19:2 (id: 1018019002)

2“The three of you must stop hurting me and discouraging me by saying that I am wicked!


## Job 19:3 (id: 1018019003)

3You have insulted me repeatedly. You should be ashamed for speaking so harshly to me!


## Job 19:4 (id: 1018019004)

4Even if it were true that I had done wrong, that would be my concern, not yours!


## Job 19:5 (id: 1018019005)

5If you truly think that you are better than I am, and if you are claiming that I must be guilty because I am suffering,


## Job 19:6 (id: 1018019006)

6you should realize that it is God who has caused me to suffer. It is as if he had a net and caught me in it, like an animal he wanted to trap.


## Job 19:7 (id: 1018019007)

7Listen to me: I protest that God is punishing me unfairly, but no one agrees with me. I cry for help, but no one, not even God, treats me fairly.


## Job 19:8 (id: 1018019008)

8It is as if God has blocked my road so that I can not go anywhere. It is as if God has forced me to try to find my way in total darkness.


## Job 19:9 (id: 1018019009)

9He has taken away my good reputation. It is as if he has taken a crown of authority off my head.


## Job 19:10 (id: 1018019010)

10He is ruining everything that I have. I no longer hope to experience good things in this life. I expect that I will soon die, as if I were a tree that he had pulled completely out of the ground.


## Job 19:11 (id: 1018019011)

11He attacks me because he is very angry with me. He treats me as if I were his enemy.


## Job 19:12 (id: 1018019012)

12It is as if he were sending an army against me that has surrounded me and is getting ready to destroy me.


## Job 19:13 (id: 1018019013)

13God has caused my family to abandon me. Those who know me now act like strangers toward me.


## Job 19:14 (id: 1018019014)

14My relatives have left me and my good friends ignore me.


## Job 19:15 (id: 1018019015)

15People who were guests in my house and even my female servants act as if they do not recognize me. They treat me like a foreigner whom they do not know.


## Job 19:16 (id: 1018019016)

16When I order my servants to come, they do not obey. I have to beg my servants to help me.


## Job 19:17 (id: 1018019017)

17My wife stays away from me, even though I was a good father to our children.


## Job 19:18 (id: 1018019018)

18Even young children disrespect me. When I stand up to talk, they laugh at me.


## Job 19:19 (id: 1018019019)

19All of my intimate friends now detest me. The people I love are hostile to me.


## Job 19:20 (id: 1018019020)

20I have become so thin that my bones are visible beneath my skin; I am barely alive.


## Job 19:21 (id: 1018019021)

21I plead with you, my three friends, pity me because God is making me suffer greatly.


## Job 19:22 (id: 1018019022)

22You should not be making me suffer as well, as if you were God and had to punish sin. You seem to think that you need to keep accusing me of doing things wrong!


## Job 19:23 (id: 1018019023)

23I wish that someone would now write what I have been saying in a book {so that people could read it}.


## Job 19:24 (id: 1018019024)

24{Or else,} I wish that someone would carve what I have said onto a rock with a chisel and highlight it with lead so that people could always read it.


## Job 19:25 (id: 1018019025)

25But I know that there is someone who will defend me and that some day he will appear here on the earth and declare me innocent.


## Job 19:26 (id: 1018019026)

26Even after I die and people bury me and my body decays, still, in my body I will see God.


## Job 19:27 (id: 1018019027)

27I will see him myself! Yes, I will see him personally! My emotions overwhelm me as I think about that!


## Job 19:28 (id: 1018019028)

28But if you three men still think that you need to accuse me of doing wrong because you believe I am responsible for the sufferings I am experiencing,


## Job 19:29 (id: 1018019029)

29then you should fear that God will punish you, because God becomes angry with unfair people like you and he punishes them. When that happens, you will know that God punishes people fairly.”


## Job 20:1 (id: 1018020001)

1Then Zophar, Job’s friend from the town of Naamah, responded to Job. He said,


## Job 20:2 (id: 1018020002)

2“What you have said troubles me greatly, so I want to reply to you right away.


## Job 20:3 (id: 1018020003)

3You have insulted me by what you have said. But I have had a good idea about how I should respond to you.


## Job 20:4 (id: 1018020004)

4People have known this for a long time, for as long as they have existed:


## Job 20:5 (id: 1018020005)

5Wicked people are only briefly successful; people who refuse to honor God are happy only for a short time.


## Job 20:6 (id: 1018020006)

6They may seem for a while to be very great and very powerful,


## Job 20:7 (id: 1018020007)

7but they will disappear forever like refuse that people throw away. People who knew them will wonder where they have gone.


## Job 20:8 (id: 1018020008)

8They will disappear the way a dream ends abruptly when a person wakes up. They will no longer exist. Yes, they will vanish just like the dreams that people have at night.


## Job 20:9 (id: 1018020009)

9Those who once saw those wicked people will never see them again. Those wicked people will no longer live where they once lived.


## Job 20:10 (id: 1018020010)

10They will have to return the valuable things that they stole from poor people. If they die before they can do that, their children will have to do it.


## Job 20:11 (id: 1018020011)

11Wicked people will die before they grow old and others will bury them in the ground.


## Job 20:12 (id: 1018020012)

12For wicked people, doing wrong things is like having sweet food in their mouths that they want to continue tasting.


## Job 20:13 (id: 1018020013)

13They do not want to stop doing wrong things, as if those things were delicious food that they enjoyed eating.


## Job 20:14 (id: 1018020014)

14{But they will regret doing those wrong things.} They will feel like people who eat what they should not eat and get a badly upset stomach that feels as if it is full of poison.


## Job 20:15 (id: 1018020015)

15Wicked people try to get as much money as they can but they do not keep it, just as people who eat too much throw up the food that they ate. God makes sure that they lose their wealth.


## Job 20:16 (id: 1018020016)

16A person who does evil deeds will die as a result, as certainly as the bite of a poisonous snake kills a person.


## Job 20:17 (id: 1018020017)

17A wicked person will not experience the abundant blessings that flow like a stream from God.


## Job 20:18 (id: 1018020018)

18Wicked people will have to give back the things that they acquired dishonestly. They will not be able to continue using those things. They will not have the opportunity to enjoy the things they got by doing business,


## Job 20:19 (id: 1018020019)

19because they oppressed poor people and refused to help them, and they took other people’s houses by cheating them.


## Job 20:20 (id: 1018020020)

20No matter how much they got, they still remained greedy, and as a result, they lost the things that they enjoyed having.


## Job 20:21 (id: 1018020021)

21When they finish eating their food, there is never anything left over, because they greedily eat it all. That is why they do not remain wealthy.


## Job 20:22 (id: 1018020022)

22While they are still very wealthy, they will suddenly experience trouble. Many people will be hostile to them and hurt them.


## Job 20:23 (id: 1018020023)

23Even as wicked people are enjoying luxuries, God will show that he is very angry with them. He will punish them with great suffering, even as they are indulging themselves.


## Job 20:24 (id: 1018020024)

24Even as they are trying to escape from smaller punishments, they will experience greater punishments.


## Job 20:25 (id: 1018020025)

25It will be as if God had shot an arrow through a wicked person’s body and he had to pull it out of his back. But the shiny point of the arrow would have cut a gash in his liver, and he would know that he was going to die.


## Job 20:26 (id: 1018020026)

26God has decided that he will destroy the valuable possessions that wicked people have. It will be as if a fire that God starts will burn them up. Yes, God will destroy every last thing that they have in their homes.


## Job 20:27 (id: 1018020027)

27The sins that those wicked people have committed will become apparent. If the sky could speak, it would tell all the wrong things it saw them do. If the earth could speak, it would also be a witness against them.


## Job 20:28 (id: 1018020028)

28On the day when God punishes people, he will take away all the possessions of wicked people. It will be as if a flood had washed them away.


## Job 20:29 (id: 1018020029)

29That is what God will do to wicked people. That is what God has decreed will happen to them.”


## Job 21:1 (id: 1018021001)

1Then Job replied to Zophar and the others. He said,


## Job 21:2 (id: 1018021002)

2“Please listen carefully to what I say. That is something that you can do to comfort me.


## Job 21:3 (id: 1018021003)

3Be patient with me, and allow me to speak. Then, after I have finished speaking, you can continue to make fun of me if you wish{, although I hope you will not}.


## Job 21:4 (id: 1018021004)

4I am not protesting to people about my suffering, I am protesting to God! And so it is certainly acceptable for me to be impatient!


## Job 21:5 (id: 1018021005)

5If you consider my situation, it will shock you. That should make you put your hands over your mouths {and say no more}!


## Job 21:6 (id: 1018021006)

6When I think about what has happened to me, I am frightened and my entire body shakes.


## Job 21:7 (id: 1018021007)

7I do not understand why wicked people live long lives and become very powerful.


## Job 21:8 (id: 1018021008)

8They live to see their children grow up and start their own households nearby.


## Job 21:9 (id: 1018021009)

9Wicked people live safely in their homes without being afraid. God does not punish them.


## Job 21:10 (id: 1018021010)

10Their bulls mate with their cows successfully. Their cows give birth to calves. They do not miscarry.


## Job 21:11 (id: 1018021011)

11Wicked people are able to send their young children outside to play {without worrying about what will happen to them}. Their children dance playfully.


## Job 21:12 (id: 1018021012)

12The children play tambourines and lyres {as they sing}, and they also play flutes happily.


## Job 21:13 (id: 1018021013)

13Wicked people enjoy having good things while they are alive, and then they die peacefully and go to the place where dead people go.


## Job 21:14 (id: 1018021014)

14While they are alive, they say to God, ‘Leave us alone; we do not care about how you want us to live our lives!’


## Job 21:15 (id: 1018021015)

15Those wicked people also say, ‘It does not matter whether we worship Shaddai. We would not get any advantage by praying to him.’


## Job 21:16 (id: 1018021016)

16Wicked people wrongly think that they have become prosperous because of what they have done. I want to think completely differently from the way they think.


## Job 21:17 (id: 1018021017)

17It often happens that wicked people die without experiencing any disasters. I do not think that God actually becomes angry with them and punishes them.


## Job 21:18 (id: 1018021018)

18God does not destroy them like straw that the wind blows away. It is never as if a whirlwind carries them off.


## Job 21:19 (id: 1018021019)

19You say, ‘When people have committed sins, God remembers and punishes their children for those sins.’ I say that God should punish the people who sin, not their children. That way sinners will know that God is punishing them for their own sins.


## Job 21:20 (id: 1018021020)

20Wicked people should have the experience of God destroying them. They should know what it is like for Shaddai to punish them in his wrath.


## Job 21:21 (id: 1018021021)

21After all, once wicked people die, they are no longer concerned for their families who are still alive.


## Job 21:22 (id: 1018021022)

22Since God judges everyone, even those who are in heaven, no one can teach him anything.


## Job 21:23 (id: 1018021023)

23Some people die while they are still very healthy. They die when their lives are peaceful and they are not afraid that bad things will happen to them.


## Job 21:24 (id: 1018021024)

24Their bodies are fat. Their bones are strong.


## Job 21:25 (id: 1018021025)

25Other people are very miserable when they die. They die before good things have happened to them.


## Job 21:26 (id: 1018021026)

26Both kinds of people die, and other people bury them. Their bodies all decompose. {Everyone dies, so it is clear that dying is not always the punishment for being wicked.}


## Job 21:27 (id: 1018021027)

27Listen, I know what you three are thinking about me. You are wrongly applying to me things that are true about wicked people.


## Job 21:28 (id: 1018021028)

28I know you are wrong because you say, ‘God does not allow evil rulers to keep living! God does not allow wicked people to keep living!’


## Job 21:29 (id: 1018021029)

29If you want to know what life on earth is really like, you should ask people who travel much {and see many things}. You will have to admit that the things they see and describe show what life is really like.


## Job 21:30 (id: 1018021030)

30{Travelers will report} that wicked people do not suffer when there are great disasters. {They will report} that wicked people escape from God’s punishment.


## Job 21:31 (id: 1018021031)

31No one dares to accuse wicked people openly of doing wrong. No one punishes them for the evil things they have done.


## Job 21:32 (id: 1018021032)

32When wicked people die, others carry their bodies to their graves in a solemn procession. Then people guard their graves to protect them.


## Job 21:33 (id: 1018021033)

33It would please wicked people to see how others build mounds over their graves to honor them. It would also please them to see how many people take part in their funeral processions. Many people walk in front of their bodies and many others walk behind them.


## Job 21:34 (id: 1018021034)

34Since all of this is true about wicked people, what you have been telling me does not make sense, and it has not comforted me. You have been trying to answer me by telling me things that are not true!”


## Job 22:1 (id: 1018022001)

1Then Eliphaz, Job’s friend from the town of Teman, replied to what Job had said. Eliphaz told him,


## Job 22:2 (id: 1018022002)

2“No one can do anything to benefit God! No, people can only do things to benefit themselves, and only if they are wise.


## Job 22:3 (id: 1018022003)

3It does not give Shaddai any extra pleasure if you live in the way you are supposed to live anyway. It does not make him better off if you improve the way you are living.


## Job 22:4 (id: 1018022004)

4God would not be punishing you in this way if you truly honored him. God would not judge you to be guilty for doing that.


## Job 22:5 (id: 1018022005)

5No, God must be punishing you because you are very wicked. You must have done a great number of evil things.


## Job 22:6 (id: 1018022006)

6You must have unfairly forced poor people to give you things to guarantee that they would pay money back to you. You must have taken the cloaks that they needed to keep them warm.


## Job 22:7 (id: 1018022007)

7You must not have given water to people who were thirsty. You must not have given food to people who were hungry.


## Job 22:8 (id: 1018022008)

8You must have refused to help others even though you were a wealthy man who owned a lot of land. You must have enjoyed a life of privilege {without being concerned for others}.


## Job 22:9 (id: 1018022009)

9When widows came to you for help, you must have sent them away without giving them anything. You must have oppressed orphans.


## Job 22:10 (id: 1018022010)

10Because you did all those things, now you are having difficulties in many different areas of your life. Things are happening all of a sudden that scare you.


## Job 22:11 (id: 1018022011)

11And so you do not know what to do, as if it had become very dark and you could not see anything. You cannot solve your problems; it is as if you were drowning in a flood of water.


## Job 22:12 (id: 1018022012)

12But God lives high up in the heavens. He looks at the earth from a place that is even higher than the stars.


## Job 22:13 (id: 1018022013)

13So you should not say, ‘God does not know what people are doing.’ You should not say, ‘Dark clouds keep him from seeing us, so he cannot judge us.’


## Job 22:14 (id: 1018022014)

14You should not say, ‘Since he walks on the dome that covers the sky, where there are thick clouds around him, and he can not see what we do.’


## Job 22:15 (id: 1018022015)

15You should not continue to conduct your life in the way that evil people have done for many years.


## Job 22:16 (id: 1018022016)

16God makes evil people die suddenly while they are still young. They go away completely, as if a flood had swept them away.


## Job 22:17 (id: 1018022017)

17Those evil people told God, ‘Leave us alone!’ They also said defiantly, ‘Shaddai can do nothing to harm us!’


## Job 22:18 (id: 1018022018)

18Even so, God mercifully gave them many things to enjoy. Nevertheless, I want to think completely differently from the way evil people think.


## Job 22:19 (id: 1018022019)

19When good people see that God punishes evil people, they are glad. People who have not done wrong say that those evil people are getting what they deserve.


## Job 22:20 (id: 1018022020)

20Those good people say, ‘Now God has destroyed our enemies! It is as if a fire has burned up everything they owned.’


## Job 22:21 (id: 1018022021)

21So, Job, I urge you to ask God to forgive you. Restore your relationship with him. If you do that, good things will happen to you.


## Job 22:22 (id: 1018022022)

22Do pay attention to what God teaches you. Meditate on what he says.


## Job 22:23 (id: 1018022023)

23If you come humbly to Shaddai, he will restore you. {God will certainly do that} if you stop doing the evil things that you have been doing.


## Job 22:24 (id: 1018022024)

24Stop trusting in your wealth. It should be as if you are throwing away your gold, even the finest gold you have, onto the dirt and rocks.


## Job 22:25 (id: 1018022025)

25If you do that, then Shaddai will be more precious to you than your gold and your silver ever were.


## Job 22:26 (id: 1018022026)

26If you do that, then your relationship with Shaddai will make you very happy. You will be able to approach God confidently.


## Job 22:27 (id: 1018022027)

27When you pray to God, he will do what you ask him to do. You will have many things to praise God for.


## Job 22:28 (id: 1018022028)

28The things that you decide to do will be successful. It will be as if a light were shining on the road in front of you so that you knew just where to walk.


## Job 22:29 (id: 1018022029)

29People may cause great difficulties for you. But when you pray and humbly ask God to help you, he will save you.


## Job 22:30 (id: 1018022030)

30God will even help people who have done wrong things if you pray for them. God will answer your prayer because you will not have done wrong things.”


## Job 23:1 (id: 1018023001)

1Then Job replied to Eliphaz and the others. He said,


## Job 23:2 (id: 1018023002)

2“I must still complain about many distressing things. There is much more that I could have protested about.


## Job 23:3 (id: 1018023003)

3I wish that I knew where I could find God. {If I knew that,} I would go to the place where he lives.


## Job 23:4 (id: 1018023004)

4I would present much evidence to God that I am innocent. I would offer many arguments to prove that.


## Job 23:5 (id: 1018023005)

5That way I would know what God would say in reply to everything I would say to him.


## Job 23:6 (id: 1018023006)

6He would not use his great power to defeat me. He would listen to me fairly.


## Job 23:7 (id: 1018023007)

7I am an honest man, so if I met with God personally, I would be able to discuss things with him reasonably. {If we could do that,} he would declare that I am innocent. After that, he would not punish me again as if I had sinned.


## Job 23:8 (id: 1018023008)

8{But I do not know where to find God.} If I went to the east, he would not be there. If I went to the west, I would not see him there.


## Job 23:9 (id: 1018023009)

9He makes natural things happen beautifully in the north, but no one there sees him doing those things. He must also go to the south, but no one sees him there either.


## Job 23:10 (id: 1018023010)

10Still, he knows how I have conducted my life. When he has finished testing me, he will see that I am as pure as gold whose impurities fire has burned out.


## Job 23:11 (id: 1018023011)

11I have lived faithfully in the manner that God wants people to live. I have not stopped living that way.


## Job 23:12 (id: 1018023012)

12I have always obeyed the commandments that he has given. I would rather go without food than disobey what God has told us to do.


## Job 23:13 (id: 1018023013)

13But God seems to have made up his mind that I am a sinner, and no one can make God change his mind. Whatever he wants to do, he does.


## Job 23:14 (id: 1018023014)

14So it seems that God will keep on punishing me until I die. If my present troubles do not kill me, I am sure that God will cause many more troubles for me!


## Job 23:15 (id: 1018023015)

15So the thought of coming into his presence greatly frightens me. When I think about what he can do, that makes me very afraid of him.


## Job 23:16 (id: 1018023016)

16I am afraid because I am no longer brave after what God has done to me. Shaddai has made me very frightened.


## Job 23:17 (id: 1018023017)

17I have lived to experience terrible things, and that is why I am so frightened. I can only imagine that the future will be just as bad as the present.


## Job 24:1 (id: 1018024001)

1Shaddai should set times when he judges evil people. The people who obey God never seem to see him judge evil people.


## Job 24:2 (id: 1018024002)

2Some evil people remove boundary markers so that they can steal other people’s land. Some evil people steal other people’s sheep and put them in with their own sheep.


## Job 24:3 (id: 1018024003)

3Some evil people take away donkeys that belong to children who have no fathers to protect them. They make loans to widows, and then they take oxen that belong to them to guarantee that the widows will pay back the money. {But without the oxen, the widows cannot grow crops, so they cannot repay the loans, and the evil people keep the oxen.}


## Job 24:4 (id: 1018024004)

4Poor people do not want evil people to know where they are, so they do not walk on the main roads. Poor people stay in hiding places in order to avoid evil people.


## Job 24:5 (id: 1018024005)

5In fact, poor people have to search in the desert plain for food to feed their children, as if they were wild donkeys.


## Job 24:6 (id: 1018024006)

6The poor people pick up leftover grain in other people’s fields. They gather leftover grapes from vineyards that evil people own.


## Job 24:7 (id: 1018024007)

7During the night they do not have thick garments to cover their bodies, so they are not able to stay warm.


## Job 24:8 (id: 1018024008)

8{Poor people have no homes, so} when rain showers come from the mountains, they get very wet. They have to huddle under rock ledges to shelter themselves from the rain.


## Job 24:9 (id: 1018024009)

9Some evil people even take babies away from their mothers while they are nursing! They take the babies as a guarantee that their mothers will repay money that they have lent them.


## Job 24:10 (id: 1018024010)

10Poor people do not have adequate clothing. They also do not have adequate food, even though they carry around bundles of grain because they work to bring in other people’s harvests.


## Job 24:11 (id: 1018024011)

11Evil people hire poor people to make oil from olives that grow on olive trees on their property. The evil people also hire poor people to tread on grapes that grow on their vines to make juice for wine. But they do not allow the poor people to drink any of the wine when they are thirsty.


## Job 24:12 (id: 1018024012)

12In the cities, poor people groan because they are suffering. People whom evil people have wounded cry out to God for help. But God does not seem to care about what the evil people are doing to them.


## Job 24:13 (id: 1018024013)

13These evil people are like others who do not obey God. They do not try to understand what God wants or to do it.


## Job 24:14 (id: 1018024014)

14Murderers go out in the dim light of morning so they can kill vulnerable people {without being caught}. They are like thieves who steal things in the dark of night {in order to avoid being caught}.


## Job 24:15 (id: 1018024015)

15Men who want to commit adultery watch for evening to come. They say, ‘I am going to make sure that no one recognizes me,’ and they disguise themselves.


## Job 24:16 (id: 1018024016)

16During the night, robbers find ways to get into other people’s houses and steal things. But during the day, they stay in their own homes. They do not like being out where it is light.


## Job 24:17 (id: 1018024017)

17These evil people all stay at home during the day because morning is as scary for them as the dark of night is for other people. They stay up at night because they like being awake at night when things happen that terrify others.


## Job 24:18 (id: 1018024018)

18However, those wicked people will not live long lives. God will keep anything from growing on the land that they own. No one will go and work in their vineyards.


## Job 24:19 (id: 1018024019)

19Just as water from melting snow dries up when it is hot and there is no rain, those evil people will go to the place where dead people go.


## Job 24:20 (id: 1018024020)

20When they die, maggots will eat their corpses, and no one will remember them. Even their mothers will forget about them! Those wicked people will be like trees that fall down and rot.


## Job 24:21 (id: 1018024021)

21Those evil people mistreat women who do not have children to care for them. Those evil people never help widows.


## Job 24:22 (id: 1018024022)

22But God, by his power, gets rid of people who hurt others because they are stronger than those others. When it is clear that God is going to punish those evil people, they know that they are going to die.


## Job 24:23 (id: 1018024023)

23God allows them to think that they are secure, and so they do not worry, but God is carefully watching how they live.


## Job 24:24 (id: 1018024024)

24Those evil people may prosper for a little while, but suddenly they will be gone. God will show that they were not greater than others. God will make them die like all other people. Then they will be like stalks of grain that farmers have cut off.


## Job 24:25 (id: 1018024025)

25What I have said is certainly true. Now that I have explained it, there is no one who can show that I am a liar and prove me wrong.”


## Job 25:1 (id: 1018025001)

1Then Bildad, Job’s friend from the Shuhite people group, responded to Job. He said,


## Job 25:2 (id: 1018025002)

2“God is very powerful. Everyone should honor him greatly. God causes everything to be orderly high up in heaven.


## Job 25:3 (id: 1018025003)

3No one can count all the stars in the sky. When the sun rises, it shines on everyone.


## Job 25:4 (id: 1018025004)

4Since God is so great, no person can be righteous compared with him. No human being is innocent by his standards.


## Job 25:5 (id: 1018025005)

5Consider this: God is so glorious that he does not even consider the full moon to be bright! Even the white light of the stars does not seem pure to him.


## Job 25:6 (id: 1018025006)

6So God would certainly not consider mortal humans to be pure!”


## Job 26:1 (id: 1018026001)

1Then Job replied to Bildad and the others. He said,


## Job 26:2 (id: 1018026002)

2“I am struggling, but you have not really helped me. I am not able to overcome my difficulties, but you have not rescued me.


## Job 26:3 (id: 1018026003)

3I need good advice, but you have not given me any. You have said many things, but they have not been helpful.


## Job 26:4 (id: 1018026004)

4I suppose you think that God helped you tell me important things. But God was not really speaking through you.


## Job 26:5 (id: 1018026005)

5{Let me tell you how great God really is.} The spirits of dead people tremble with fear at God. They are deep in the earth, below the waters where the sea creatures live.


## Job 26:6 (id: 1018026006)

6God knows all about those who are in the place where dead people go. Nothing prevents God from seeing what is there.


## Job 26:7 (id: 1018026007)

7God created the dome of the sky to make an orderly world. God created the dry land where previously there was nowhere for people to live.


## Job 26:8 (id: 1018026008)

8God uses clouds as containers for rainwater, and he prevents that water from bursting the clouds.


## Job 26:9 (id: 1018026009)

9God can make clouds so thick that even the bright moon cannot shine through them.


## Job 26:10 (id: 1018026010)

10God has set the horizon in place as the outer edge of the oceans. The horizon is at the place where the sky meets the earth.


## Job 26:11 (id: 1018026011)

11Sometimes even the mountains that hold up the sky shake, as if God were scolding them and they were afraid.


## Job 26:12 (id: 1018026012)

12God used his power to restrain the oceans; by his skill he destroyed Rahab, the huge sea monster.


## Job 26:13 (id: 1018026013)

13God can make the sky clear by blowing away the clouds. {God brings order everywhere in creation} by overcoming the forces of chaos.


## Job 26:14 (id: 1018026014)

14But I have described only a little bit of what God does. It is as if we can only hear someone whisper about him. When we hear mighty thunder, we realize that God is far too great for us to understand.


## Job 27:1 (id: 1018027001)

1Job kept speaking to his three friends. He said,


## Job 27:2 (id: 1018027002)

2“I will promise you something as surely as God exists, even though he has treated me unfairly. I will promise you something as surely as Shaddai exists, even though he has made my life so unpleasant.


## Job 27:3 (id: 1018027003)

3I will insist on it for as long as I am alive. Yes, for as long as I am still breathing, I will insist on it.


## Job 27:4 (id: 1018027004)

4I promise that I will not say the wrong thing! I promise that I will not say anything to deceive anyone!


## Job 27:5 (id: 1018027005)

5And so I will never say that what you three have said about me is true. Until the day that I die, I will insist that I have been living as God wants people to live.


## Job 27:6 (id: 1018027006)

6I will insist that I am innocent. I will never say anything different. That way, for as long as I live, I will not feel badly about saying something that was not true.


## Job 27:7 (id: 1018027007)

7I want to be just the opposite of an evil person. I want to disagree with the way anyone who is a bad person is living.


## Job 27:8 (id: 1018027008)

8I want to be the opposite of an evil person because when God decides it is time for that person to die, he can only expect that God will then punish him for the wrong things that he has done.


## Job 27:9 (id: 1018027009)

9When evil people are in trouble, God does not rescue them when they pray for help.


## Job 27:10 (id: 1018027010)

10Evil people are not happy about what Shaddai does. They do not speak with God in prayer in good times as well as in bad times.


## Job 27:11 (id: 1018027011)

11I need to teach you three something about how God actually deals with the people of this world.


## Job 27:12 (id: 1018027012)

12You three have certainly seen for yourselves how God treats people. So you should not have been telling me things that have made so little sense.


## Job 27:13 (id: 1018027013)

13I will tell you how God punishes evil people. This is what Shaddai does to those who mistreat others:


## Job 27:14 (id: 1018027014)

14Even if they have many children, those children will die in wars, or they will die because they do not have enough food to eat.


## Job 27:15 (id: 1018027015)

15Any children who are still alive after their evil parents die will perish from diseases. Not even the wife of an evil man will mourn for him if he dies.


## Job 27:16 (id: 1018027016)

16Sometimes evil people accumulate a large amount of money and they acquire many valuable articles of clothing.


## Job 27:17 (id: 1018027017)

17But even if evil people become rich, they will die, and then righteous people will get their clothes. Honest people will get their money and share it with one another.


## Job 27:18 (id: 1018027018)

18The houses that they build are as weak as spider webs. Their houses are flimsy, like the huts that watchmen live in while they guard people’s fields.


## Job 27:19 (id: 1018027019)

19God makes evil people lose their money. It is as if they are rich when they go to bed one night, but the next morning they wake up to find that their money is all gone.


## Job 27:20 (id: 1018027020)

20When evil people realize that God is punishing them, they become very afraid, as if those fears were water in which they were drowning. God soon destroys the evil people, as if a whirlwind carried them away in the night.


## Job 27:21 (id: 1018027021)

21It is as if a windstorm from the desert picks them up and carries them away from their homes. No one ever sees them again.


## Job 27:22 (id: 1018027022)

22It is as if a wind like that blows steadily against them while they are running away, trying to escape from its force.


## Job 27:23 (id: 1018027023)

23It is as if such a wind were clapping its hands at them to mock them. It is as if such a wind blew them out of their houses and stayed there laughing at them.


## Job 28:1 (id: 1018028001)

1“There certainly are places where people dig to find silver. There certainly are places where people refine gold that they have dug from the ground.


## Job 28:2 (id: 1018028002)

2People get iron from ore that they dig out of the ground. They get copper by heating and melting ore that contains it.


## Job 28:3 (id: 1018028003)

3People use lamps so that they can see while they work far down under the ground. They search for ore in many places where it is very dark.


## Job 28:4 (id: 1018028004)

4People dig shafts deep into the ground in places that are far from where other people live, As they work underground, the people who walk above them are not aware of them. People have to climb down ropes in order to descend into the deep shafts they have dug.


## Job 28:5 (id: 1018028005)

5Food grows on the surface of the ground. But deep below the ground, miners make fires to break apart the rocks.


## Job 28:6 (id: 1018028006)

6The stones that people dig from under the ground contain sapphires. The dirt they dig up contains bits of gold.


## Job 28:7 (id: 1018028007)

7Even birds that have very good eyesight can not see deep down into these mines. Even birds such as falcons have not looked into them.


## Job 28:8 (id: 1018028008)

8Strong beasts can go wherever they want, but they have never gone to those places. Not even lions have gone there.


## Job 28:9 (id: 1018028009)

9Miners dig through even very hard rock. It is as though they are turning mountains upside down in order to get at the ore that is at the bases of them.


## Job 28:10 (id: 1018028010)

10Miners cut tunnels through rocks in order to find many precious things.


## Job 28:11 (id: 1018028011)

11They dam up small streams to stop the water from flowing. That allows them to find things that were hidden beneath the water of the streams.


## Job 28:12 (id: 1018028012)

12{It takes great effort to find valuable ore.} It is even more difficult to obtain wisdom. Yes, it is very difficult to obtain understanding.


## Job 28:13 (id: 1018028013)

13Humans do not know how to obtain wisdom. Wisdom is not available on earth, where people live.


## Job 28:14 (id: 1018028014)

14It is as though the ocean depths and the water of the seas said, ‘There is no wisdom here!’


## Job 28:15 (id: 1018028015)

15People can not buy wisdom by paying for it with gold or silver.


## Job 28:16 (id: 1018028016)

16Wisdom is worth much more than fine gold that comes from the land of Ophir. {Wisdom is worth much more} than very valuable stones.


## Job 28:17 (id: 1018028017)

17Wisdom is worth much more than gold or beautiful quartz. It is more expensive than an article made of pure gold.


## Job 28:18 (id: 1018028018)

18Wisdom is worth more than coral or jasper. The price of wisdom is higher than the price of rubies.


## Job 28:19 (id: 1018028019)

19Wisdom is worth more than topaz from the land of Cush. One can not express the value of wisdom even in terms of gold.


## Job 28:20 (id: 1018028020)

20So, then, wisdom is very difficult to obtain; understanding is indeed a very valuable thing to get.


## Job 28:21 (id: 1018028021)

21Living creatures are not able to see it. Not even the birds can see it while they are up in the sky.


## Job 28:22 (id: 1018028022)

22Even after people die, they do not have a better experience of wisdom in the different place to which they go.


## Job 28:23 (id: 1018028023)

23God is the only one who knows how people can become wise.


## Job 28:24 (id: 1018028024)

24God knows this because he can see everything on earth, even in its most remote places. God can see everything that is below the sky.


## Job 28:25 (id: 1018028025)

25He decided how strongly the winds should blow and how much rain should be in the clouds.


## Job 28:26 (id: 1018028026)

26God decided where rain should fall and what path lightning should take from the clouds down to the ground.


## Job 28:27 (id: 1018028027)

27At that time, he identified wisdom and recognized that it was very valuable. He was delighted by its capabilities and made it a permanent part of his creation.


## Job 28:28 (id: 1018028028)

28Then God told human beings, ‘Listen! You will become wise to the extent that you respect me. If you want to understand what you should do, you must first decide that you will not do anything wicked.’


## Job 29:1 (id: 1018029001)

1Job kept speaking to his three friends. He said,


## Job 29:2 (id: 1018029002)

2“I wish that I could be as I was previously during the time when God was taking care of me.


## Job 29:3 (id: 1018029003)

3During that time, it was if God was shining a light on me so that I could see where I was going even in the darkness.


## Job 29:4 (id: 1018029004)

4At that time I was young and strong. Because God was my friend, he protected where I lived.


## Job 29:5 (id: 1018029005)

5Shaddai was still present with me during that time when all my children were still alive and living near me.


## Job 29:6 (id: 1018029006)

6My herds provided me with plenty of milk. My olive trees provided me with plenty of oil.


## Job 29:7 (id: 1018029007)

7I used to go to the place where the elders gathered at the city gate. The people had reserved a seat for me there, and I would sit in it.


## Job 29:8 (id: 1018029008)

8When young men saw me, they stepped aside respectfully. When older men saw me, they stood up respectfully.


## Job 29:9 (id: 1018029009)

9The leaders of the people used to stop talking when I arrived. They made sure they did not say anything{, because they knew it would not be as good as what I was going to say}.


## Job 29:10 (id: 1018029010)

10Even the most important leaders became quiet. It was as if they were not even able to speak.


## Job 29:11 (id: 1018029011)

11When people heard what I had to say, they said good things about me. They recognized that I had given wise counsel, and they approved of me


## Job 29:12 (id: 1018029012)

12{They approved of me} because I had helped those who were poor and who were calling for help. {They also approved of me because) I aided orphans who had no fathers to help them.


## Job 29:13 (id: 1018029013)

13People who had been suffering and were about to die praised me {for rescuing them}. I made widows very happy by helping them.


## Job 29:14 (id: 1018029014)

14It was in my character to make sure that I and others did what was right. Yes, it was in my character to make sure that people treated one another in a way that was just.


## Job 29:15 (id: 1018029015)

15I helped people who could not see, as if I were seeing for them. I helped people who could not walk, as if I were walking for them.


## Job 29:16 (id: 1018029016)

16I protected poor people the way a father protects his children. In the courts, I defended even people who were strangers to me.


## Job 29:17 (id: 1018029017)

17I made wicked people stop oppressing others. It was as if I were breaking the jaws of a wild animal to make it drop its victim from its teeth.


## Job 29:18 (id: 1018029018)

18At that time I thought, ‘I am certainly going to live a long life, and then I will die at home with my family.


## Job 29:19 (id: 1018029019)

19I am like a tree whose roots reach down into the water and whose branches become wet with dew each night.


## Job 29:20 (id: 1018029020)

20People continually honor me, and I stay strong like a new bow.’


## Job 29:21 (id: 1018029021)

21When I spoke, people waited to hear what I would say. They remained silent until I advised them what they should do.


## Job 29:22 (id: 1018029022)

22After I finished speaking, they did not say anything, because what I had said was so satisfying.


## Job 29:23 (id: 1018029023)

23They were as eager to hear me speak as farmers are for it to rain. They listened to me with great appreciation, just as the ground seems to welcome the rain that falls in the spring.


## Job 29:24 (id: 1018029024)

24I helped people who felt discouraged. I remained cheerful even as I helped them deal with difficult situations.


## Job 29:25 (id: 1018029025)

25As their leader, I decided what things would be good for them to do. They respected me, just as soldiers respect the king who commands their army. I was kind and sympathetic, like someone who comforts people who are mourning.


## Job 30:1 (id: 1018030001)

1“But now, men who are younger than I am make fun of me. They are men whose fathers I would not even have hired to help my dogs guard my sheep!


## Job 30:2 (id: 1018030002)

2And I would not hire any of those young men to work for me either. They are already feeble.


## Job 30:3 (id: 1018030003)

3{No one hires them,} so they are poor and go hungry and have become thin. They have to eat roots that they find in places where no crops have grown for a long time.


## Job 30:4 (id: 1018030004)

4They look among bushes to find leaves that they can eat. They pull up broom trees and eat their roots.


## Job 30:5 (id: 1018030005)

5{When they come near villages,} people shout at them, as they would at a thief, to make them leave their area.


## Job 30:6 (id: 1018030006)

6They have to live in riverbeds, in holes in the ground, and in caves on the sides of cliffs.


## Job 30:7 (id: 1018030007)

7{During the day} they huddle under thorn bushes. There they howl like animals because they are so hungry.


## Job 30:8 (id: 1018030008)

8They are people without good sense, and they have never achieved anything significant. People force them to leave their towns.


## Job 30:9 (id: 1018030009)

9But these despicable young men sing songs to make fun of me! If they think God is punishing someone for being a sinner, they call that person ‘another Job.’


## Job 30:10 (id: 1018030010)

10They hate me and they stay away from me, but if we happen to meet, they spit right in my face.


## Job 30:11 (id: 1018030011)

11I am not able to defend myself against these young men, because God has taken away my strength. He has humiliated me. So they can do whatever they want to me.


## Job 30:12 (id: 1018030012)

12Gangs of these young men threaten me. They shove me aside when they pass by. They think of new ways to hurt me.


## Job 30:13 (id: 1018030013)

13I am not able to escape from them, even as they keep doing worse things to me. No one else would do the things they do to me.


## Job 30:14 (id: 1018030014)

14It is as if I were a city and they were an army that had broken through its wall and sent in waves of troops to destroy the city.


## Job 30:15 (id: 1018030015)

15I am afraid of many things. I have no dignity left, and I do not expect that I will ever get out of this situation.


## Job 30:16 (id: 1018030016)

16I feel as if I am about to die, but in the meantime, I am suffering greatly.


## Job 30:17 (id: 1018030017)

17My body aches during the night. I feel pain continually.


## Job 30:18 (id: 1018030018)

18I have such a serious disease that my skin no longer looks the same. It seems as if I will always be sick.


## Job 30:19 (id: 1018030019)

19God has made me suffer so much that I have been sitting here on the ground. I am even beginning to look like the dust and ashes in which I have been sitting.


## Job 30:20 (id: 1018030020)

20Even though I pray to you, God, you do not respond. I try to get your attention, but you do not do anything to help me.


## Job 30:21 (id: 1018030021)

21You used to be kind to me, but you are not kind to me anymore. You are using your mighty power to make me suffer.


## Job 30:22 (id: 1018030022)

22It is as if you have sent a great wind to pick me up and carry me away. It is as if you are making a violent storm blow me around.


## Job 30:23 (id: 1018030023)

23Certainly I know that you are going to make me die. That is what happens to everyone who ever lives.


## Job 30:24 (id: 1018030024)

24However, when someone falls down, he certainly reaches out with his hand for help. When someone is in trouble, he certainly calls for help.


## Job 30:25 (id: 1018030025)

25{So it is appropriate for me to ask for your help now, God.} After all, I wept for people myself when they were experiencing troubles. I felt sorry for poor people.


## Job 30:26 (id: 1018030026)

26I am asking for help because although I expected good things to happen to me, evil things happened instead. It was as if I was waiting for dawn but another night started instead of a new day.


## Job 30:27 (id: 1018030027)

27I am very distressed all the time. I suffer during every day.


## Job 30:28 (id: 1018030028)

28I look as if I have to work outside all day to make a living. I humble myself by pleading openly for people to help me.


## Job 30:29 (id: 1018030029)

29{No one wants to come near me.} It is as if I am a jackal or ostrich living out in the wilderness.


## Job 30:30 (id: 1018030030)

30My skin has become dark, and it is peeling off. I have a fever that causes my body to feel as if it were burning up.


## Job 30:31 (id: 1018030031)

31Previously, if you came to my house, you would hear musical instruments playing happy songs. If you came now, you would only hear people crying and singing sad songs.


## Job 31:1 (id: 1018031001)

1“I have made a solemn promise to myself that I will not look at a woman in a lustful way. So I would not look at a woman who was not my wife and want to have sexual relations with her.


## Job 31:2 (id: 1018031002)

2{If I did not do what I promised,} God who is in heaven would certainly punish me. Shaddai in heaven would make sure that I got what I deserved.


## Job 31:3 (id: 1018031003)

3{I would not have done wrong in that way, because I know that} unrighteous people experience calamities. People who do what is wrong experience disasters {when God punishes them}.


## Job 31:4 (id: 1018031004)

4I know that God sees everything that I do. He is aware of each individual action that I take.


## Job 31:5 (id: 1018031005)

5I solemnly declare that I have not lied to others and that I have not tried to deceive others.


## Job 31:6 (id: 1018031006)

6I only ask God to judge me fairly. If he does that, he will find that I am innocent.


## Job 31:7 (id: 1018031007)

7I solemnly declare that I have continually acted properly. I have not seen wrong things to do and then done them. I am not guilty of committing sin.


## Job 31:8 (id: 1018031008)

8If I have been lustful or deceptive, I hope that when I plant seeds, someone else will harvest the crops and eat them. Or may someone uproot the crops that are growing in my fields!


## Job 31:9 (id: 1018031009)

9I solemnly declare that I have not been attracted to another man’s wife. I have not made secret arrangements with a woman to have sexual relations with her while her husband was away.


## Job 31:10 (id: 1018031010)

10If I have done that, I hope that my own wife will be attracted to another man and that she will have sexual relations with him.


## Job 31:11 (id: 1018031011)

11If I had sexual relations with another man’s wife, that would be a terrible sin. If I were caught and her husband brought me to court, the judges would certainly decide to punish me.


## Job 31:12 (id: 1018031012)

12{I would have to pay a fine that would cost me everything I owned.} It would be as if a fire had burned everything I had right to the ground. It would be as if someone pulled out all the crops that were growing in my fields.


## Job 31:13 (id: 1018031013)

13I solemnly declare that when my male or female servants complained to me about something, I took their complaint seriously and made sure that I treated them fairly.


## Job 31:14 (id: 1018031014)

14I knew that if I did not treat my servants fairly, I could not expect God to be merciful to me when he judged me. If God came to help my servants, I could offer no excuse for the way I had treated them.


## Job 31:15 (id: 1018031015)

15{I am no different from my servants, so I have no right to mistreat them.} The same God created each one of us.


## Job 31:16 (id: 1018031016)

16(16\-18\) I solemnly declare that from the time that I was young, I have taken care of orphans and I have protected widows. I have not failed to provide poor people with the things that they needed. I have not caused widows to lose hope. I have not eaten all of my food by myself and not shared it with orphans.


## Job 31:19 (id: 1018031019)

19I solemnly declare that I provided clothes for poor people when I saw that they were suffering from lack of clothing. I have provided warm outer garments for needy people.


## Job 31:20 (id: 1018031020)

20I gave them warm clothes that my servants had woven from the wool of my sheep. The poor people thanked me for helping them.


## Job 31:21 (id: 1018031021)

21I solemnly declare that I never threatened an orphan who brought a case against me in the public square. Even if I knew that the other elders would favor me, I made sure that the orphan received fair treatment.


## Job 31:22 (id: 1018031022)

22If I have neglected poor people or oppressed orphans, may the arm {that I did not use to help them but used instead to threaten them} fall right out of its socket!


## Job 31:23 (id: 1018031023)

23I have not done wrong things such as I have been describing, because I respect God and I know that he punishes sin. I would not sin against such a majestic God!


## Job 31:24 (id: 1018031024)

24I solemnly declare that I have not depended on wealth as a source of security and power.


## Job 31:25 (id: 1018031025)

25I solemnly declare that I did not think that I was better than other people because I had many possessions and because I had become very rich.


## Job 31:26 (id: 1018031026)

26I solemnly declare that I never looked at the sun when it was shining or at the beautiful moon


## Job 31:27 (id: 1018031027)

27and made a gesture to worship them. I never wanted to do that.


## Job 31:28 (id: 1018031028)

28If I had worshiped the sun or the moon and people found out that I had, the judges would certainly decide to punish me for that too, because I would have been worshiping a false god instead of the true God.


## Job 31:29 (id: 1018031029)

29(29\-30\) I solemnly declare that I have not been glad when my enemies have suffered misfortunes. I have not thought that I was better than they were when they experienced disasters. I have not sinned by praying that God would curse people who hated me and cause them to die.


## Job 31:31 (id: 1018031031)

31(31\-32\) I solemnly declare that I have invited travelers to stay in my house. Visitors have not had to sleep in the streets. My servants talk about how I give food to anyone who needs it.


## Job 31:33 (id: 1018031033)

33I know that people generally try to hide their sins. But I solemnly declare that I have not done that.


## Job 31:34 (id: 1018031034)

34I did not let fear of what people would say about me or think of me keep me from admitting that I had done wrong and making amends.


## Job 31:35 (id: 1018031035)

35I wish that I had someone who would judge my case against God! I hereby declare that all that I have just said is true. Now I wish that Shaddai would state his case. I would like to see his written statement of charges against me.


## Job 31:36 (id: 1018031036)

36If Shaddai wrote out his charges against me, I would not be ashamed, because I know that I am innocent. I would display the charges publicly{, because they would actually list what I had not done}.


## Job 31:37 (id: 1018031037)

37I would explain to God in detail how I was innocent of each charge. I would approach him as a ruler would: without being afraid.


## Job 31:38 (id: 1018031038)

38I solemnly declare that I have not defrauded the people who farm my land. They have no reason to cry out for justice against me.


## Job 31:39 (id: 1018031039)

39I solemnly declare that I have taken only a fair share of the crops that people have grown on my land. I have made sure that the people who grew crops on my land kept enough of them to feed their families.


## Job 31:40 (id: 1018031040)

40If I have cheated the people who farm my land, then I wish that thorns would grow in my fields instead of wheat. I wish that bad weeds would grow there instead of barley!” After this, Job said nothing further to defend himself to his three friends.


## Job 32:1 (id: 1018032001)

1Then Job’s three friends stopped replying to him, because Job was confident that he was innocent.


## Job 32:2 (id: 1018032002)

2Then a man named Elihu{, who had been listening as Job spoke with his friends,} became very angry with Job. Elihu was the son of Barakel. He was from the Buzite people group. He belonged to the clan of Ram. He became angry because Job continued to claim that he was innocent and that God had been wrong to punish him.


## Job 32:3 (id: 1018032003)

3Elihu also became angry with Job’s three friends. He became angry because they had insisted that Job must have done many things that were wrong, but they had not been able to prove any of their accusations.


## Job 32:4 (id: 1018032004)

4Now Elihu was much younger than Job’s three friends. That was why he had let them speak to Job first.


## Job 32:5 (id: 1018032005)

5But when Elihu realized that the three men had nothing more to say to Job, he became very angry.


## Job 32:6 (id: 1018032006)

6This is what Elihu said. (He was the son of Barakel. He was from the Buzite people group.) “I am young, and you all are much older than I am. So I was hesitant. I was afraid to tell you what I was thinking.


## Job 32:7 (id: 1018032007)

7I said to myself, ‘I should let the people who are older speak. Older people should be able to explain how to understand things wisely.’


## Job 32:8 (id: 1018032008)

8However, even as I was saying that, I felt the Spirit of God stirring within me. Yes, I felt Shaddai inspiring me so that I could understand.


## Job 32:9 (id: 1018032009)

9Humble people can also be wise. Younger people can also recognize the right thing to do.


## Job 32:10 (id: 1018032010)

10So now I want to ask you, ‘Please listen to me. Let me too say what I have been thinking.’


## Job 32:11 (id: 1018032011)

11Now I let the three of you speak first. I waited while you thought carefully about what you should say, and I listened to your arguments.


## Job 32:12 (id: 1018032012)

12I paid careful attention to what you were saying. But in the end, none of you was able to prove that what Job said was wrong. None of you could respond to his arguments.


## Job 32:13 (id: 1018032013)

13So do not tell yourselves, ‘We have discovered what is wise!’ It is God who must show Job that he is wrong. Someone relying on human thinking will not be able to do that.


## Job 32:14 (id: 1018032014)

14You were angry with Job, and so you have not answered him well. But Job has said nothing to make me angry, so I will not answer him the way you have.


## Job 32:15 (id: 1018032015)

15The three of you are just sitting there in a daze, not saying anything more, because you cannot think of what to say to Job.


## Job 32:16 (id: 1018032016)

16And since you are not speaking, since you have stopped answering Job, I do not feel that I need to wait any longer before speaking to Job myself.


## Job 32:17 (id: 1018032017)

17So now I too will respond to Job. I will share my view of his situation.


## Job 32:18 (id: 1018032018)

18I must speak, because I have plenty to say, and something inside me is forcing me to say it.


## Job 32:19 (id: 1018032019)

19I feel as if I am a container of wine that is stretching more and more and that will soon burst because of the fermentation.


## Job 32:20 (id: 1018032020)

20I must speak, and then I will be able to rest from the effort of restraining myself from speaking. So I will now say something in reply to all of you.


## Job 32:21 (id: 1018032021)

21I will not favor either Job or you his friends. I will not try to flatter anyone.


## Job 32:22 (id: 1018032022)

22Indeed, I have not gotten into the habit of flattering people, because I believe that if I did that, God would quickly destroy me.


## Job 33:1 (id: 1018033001)

1So now, Job, I ask you to listen carefully to everything that I am going to say.


## Job 33:2 (id: 1018033002)

2I am ready to speak to you and tell you what I think.


## Job 33:3 (id: 1018033003)

3What I say will express my sincere feelings of concern for you. I will only tell you what is genuinely true.


## Job 33:4 (id: 1018033004)

4You can trust me as someone whom God’s Spirit created. You can trust me as someone whom Shaddai made alive.


## Job 33:5 (id: 1018033005)

5{Once I have spoken,} respond to me if you can. Think carefully about how you will reply to me.


## Job 33:6 (id: 1018033006)

6Now you wanted God to answer you, and I will do that for him. But I am human, just like you,


## Job 33:7 (id: 1018033007)

7so you do not need to be afraid of me. I will not speak to you harshly.


## Job 33:8 (id: 1018033008)

8I listened carefully to you as you spoke, and this is what I heard you say:


## Job 33:9 (id: 1018033009)

9‘I am righteous. I have not committed any sins. I am innocent. I have not done things that are wrong.


## Job 33:10 (id: 1018033010)

10Nevertheless, God looks for excuses to punish me. He treats me as if I were his enemy.


## Job 33:11 (id: 1018033011)

11He judges me by very strict standards. He closely observes everything that I do.’


## Job 33:12 (id: 1018033012)

12However, what you have said is incorrect. I will explain why. {You do not realize what God is actually doing, since} it is beyond human understanding.


## Job 33:13 (id: 1018033013)

13You should not be protesting that God does not respond to what anyone says.


## Job 33:14 (id: 1018033014)

14God actually does speak to people in various ways. People just do not realize how he is doing that.


## Job 33:15 (id: 1018033015)

15Sometimes God speaks to people at night in dreams and visions when they are sound asleep in bed.


## Job 33:16 (id: 1018033016)

16God reveals things to people at those times. He shows them that they need to change the way that they have been living.


## Job 33:17 (id: 1018033017)

17God speaks in that way to get people to stop doing evil deeds. God wants to prevent people from sinning because they have become proud.


## Job 33:18 (id: 1018033018)

18In this way, God prevents people from dying. Otherwise, someone might kill them violently.


## Job 33:19 (id: 1018033019)

19God also corrects people by making them so ill that they have to lie in bed. They feel constant agony in their bodies.


## Job 33:20 (id: 1018033020)

20They feel so sick that they do not want to eat anything, not even their favorite foods.


## Job 33:21 (id: 1018033021)

21They lose so much weight that there appears to be no flesh between their skin and their bones.


## Job 33:22 (id: 1018033022)

22They become so sick that they are about to die. The angels who cause people to die start coming to get them.


## Job 33:23 (id: 1018033023)

23However, sometimes a special kind of angel may come to a person and tell him on behalf of God how he can change the way that he has been living so that he will not die.


## Job 33:24 (id: 1018033024)

24{If the person changes the way that he has been living,} then God will forgive him. God will tell the angels who cause people to die, ‘Do not cause this person to die! I can see that I should allow him to live, because now he will do what is right.’


## Job 33:25 (id: 1018033025)

25When that happens, the person will become healthy again and his skin will appear as fresh as the skin of a child. He will be as strong again as he was when he was young.


## Job 33:26 (id: 1018033026)

26Then God will once again treat him as a righteous person. He will pray to God, and God will answer his prayer. He will come into God’s presence joyfully.


## Job 33:27 (id: 1018033027)

27He will sing a song of thanksgiving and tell the people who are listening, ‘I sinned; yes, I did things that were not right, but God did not punish me in the way that I deserved.


## Job 33:28 (id: 1018033028)

28He has saved me from going to the place where dead people are. And so I will continue to enjoy being alive!’


## Job 33:29 (id: 1018033029)

29Indeed, God does this for many people.


## Job 33:30 (id: 1018033030)

30He keeps them from going to the place where dead people are. That way they can continue to enjoy being alive.


## Job 33:31 (id: 1018033031)

31So Job, please listen to me. Do not say anything right now; just allow me to speak.


## Job 33:32 (id: 1018033032)

32{After I have spoken, then} if you have something more that you want to say to me, say it, because I would like to show that you are innocent.


## Job 33:33 (id: 1018033033)

33However, if you have nothing more that you want to say, then just listen to me. I will explain to you how you can understand your situation in a wise way.”


## Job 34:1 (id: 1018034001)

1Then Elihu continued to speak, and he said,


## Job 34:2 (id: 1018034002)

2“I want everyone who is wise to hear what I am about to say. I want everyone who knows a lot to listen to me.


## Job 34:3 (id: 1018034003)

3I want you to listen carefully to me because when people hear others speak, they need to decide whether what the others are saying is right or wrong. They do this just as people taste food to decide whether it is good or bad.


## Job 34:4 (id: 1018034004)

4I would like all of us to decide together who is right, Job or his friends. I would like us to find out together what is a good way to understand his situation.


## Job 34:5 (id: 1018034005)

5We need to consider this carefully together because Job has said, ‘I am innocent, but God has not judged me fairly.’


## Job 34:6 (id: 1018034006)

6Job has said he would not lie about whether he has done what is right. He has spoken as if God had shot him with an arrow and wounded him so badly that he will die, even though he is innocent.


## Job 34:7 (id: 1018034007)

7I have not heard anyone else speak the way Job does. People drink water to satisfy their thirst, and mocking God seems to satisfy Job.


## Job 34:8 (id: 1018034008)

8His friends are people who do what is wrong. He spends time with wicked people.


## Job 34:9 (id: 1018034009)

9We know that this is true about him because he has said, ‘It is useless for people to want to please God.’


## Job 34:10 (id: 1018034010)

10So, all of you who understand things well, listen to me! God would never consider doing anything that was wicked! No, Shaddai would never consider doing anything that was wrong!


## Job 34:11 (id: 1018034011)

11We can be confident that God treats people fairly because we can see that he rewards or punishes people properly for what they have done. God gives people what they deserve for the manner in which they have lived.


## Job 34:12 (id: 1018034012)

12No, God never does anything wicked. Shaddai always treats people fairly.


## Job 34:13 (id: 1018034013)

13God did not need anyone to give him the authority to rule the people who live on the earth. He did not need anyone to put him in control of all the people in the world.


## Job 34:14 (id: 1018034014)

14If God ever thought only about himself and not also about the world he created, if God ever stopped keeping people and animals alive,


## Job 34:15 (id: 1018034015)

15then every living thing would die immediately, and the bodies of people would soon become soil again.


## Job 34:16 (id: 1018034016)

16So, Job, if you truly want to understand, then listen carefully to what I am about to say.


## Job 34:17 (id: 1018034017)

17God could certainly not hate what is right and still rule the world. So you really cannot say that God, who is righteous and powerful, has done something wrong.


## Job 34:18 (id: 1018034018)

18God tells some kings that they are worthless, and he says to some officials that they are wicked.


## Job 34:19 (id: 1018034019)

19God does not treat rulers better than he treats other people. God does not treat rich people more respectfully than he treats poor people. After all, God created all people.


## Job 34:20 (id: 1018034020)

20If people use their power to oppress others, God punishes them by killing them. Those people are not expecting to have troubles and die, and humans do not kill them, but God kills them very quickly.


## Job 34:21 (id: 1018034021)

21God punishes oppressive people because he sees everything that people do. God is aware of each individual action that a person does.


## Job 34:22 (id: 1018034022)

22Wicked people can not escape from God by hiding in places where it is very dark.


## Job 34:23 (id: 1018034023)

23Now God does not need to examine a person further before passing judgment on that person.


## Job 34:24 (id: 1018034024)

24God does not need to investigate what people have done. He knows whether important people have done wrong, and he destroys them if they have. He then appoints others to take their places.


## Job 34:25 (id: 1018034025)

25Because he already knows what they have done, he removes them quickly and gets rid of them.


## Job 34:26 (id: 1018034026)

26God kills them because of the wicked things that they have done. Many people see him do it.


## Job 34:27 (id: 1018034027)

27God kills them because they stopped doing what he wanted them to do and did not pay attention to his commands.


## Job 34:28 (id: 1018034028)

28They mistreated poor people. Those poor people prayed to God for help, and God answered their prayers.


## Job 34:29 (id: 1018034029)

29Yet even if God decides not to punish wicked people right away, no one can criticize him. If God does not reveal what he is doing, no one can understand it. God controls every nation and every person.


## Job 34:30 (id: 1018034030)

30God makes sure that those who rule honor him. He makes sure that rulers do not oppress the people whom they rule.


## Job 34:31 (id: 1018034031)

31Suppose someone says to God, ‘I recognize that I am suffering because I have sinned. I do not want to sin any longer.


## Job 34:32 (id: 1018034032)

32Please show me what sins I have committed. I will stop doing anything that is evil.’


## Job 34:33 (id: 1018034033)

33If a person said that to God, do you think that God would continue to punish him? Now you have been saying that God does not treat people fairly, so it is important for you to decide what you think God would do. I will not suggest the answer myself. We would like to hear you say what you think about this.


## Job 34:34 (id: 1018034034)

34{But unfortunately, I believe that} when people who have good sense and people who are wise hear my question and your answer, they will say to me,


## Job 34:35 (id: 1018034035)

35‘Job is speaking ignorantly. What he says does not make sense.’


## Job 34:36 (id: 1018034036)

36It would be good if God put Job on trial and investigated every last detail of his case. God should do that because Job has been speaking just as wicked people speak.


## Job 34:37 (id: 1018034037)

37God should put Job on trial because in addition to sinning, he is saying that God does not treat people fairly. Knowing that we were watching, he clapped his hands to insult God. He has made long speeches to say that God has punished him unjustly.”


## Job 35:1 (id: 1018035001)

1Then Elihu continued to speak, and he said,


## Job 35:2 (id: 1018035002)

2“Job, it is not right for you to say that you have been doing what is right but God has been doing what is wrong.


## Job 35:3 (id: 1018035003)

3You are basically saying that when you ask, ‘What good things have I received because I have not sinned? How am I better off than I would be if I had sinned?’


## Job 35:4 (id: 1018035004)

4I will answer those questions for you, and I will also respond to what your three friends have said.


## Job 35:5 (id: 1018035005)

5Job, look up at the sky. See how high the clouds are above you! {God is far higher than that!}


## Job 35:6 (id: 1018035006)

6So if you sin, that does not harm God at all. Even if you do many wrong things, that does not hurt him.


## Job 35:7 (id: 1018035007)

7On the other hand, if you do what is right, that does not make God better off. No, you are not giving God something that he does not already have.


## Job 35:8 (id: 1018035008)

8The only ones who suffer if you are wicked are other people. The only ones you might help by being good are other humans.


## Job 35:9 (id: 1018035009)

9People call for others to help them because of the many things that wicked people do that make them suffer. They call for help because of the things that powerful people do to oppress them.


## Job 35:10 (id: 1018035010)

10But people do not ask God, their Creator, to help them. People do not expect God to enable them to sing joyful songs because he has rescued them.


## Job 35:11 (id: 1018035011)

11People do not realize that God wants to teach them how to live wisely. God does that for people, not for wild animals or for the birds in the sky.


## Job 35:12 (id: 1018035012)

12Even when people do pray to God for help, God does not answer them, because they arrogantly continue to do what is wrong.


## Job 35:13 (id: 1018035013)

13God, the Almighty One, does not respond at all when people pray but do not really mean what they are saying.


## Job 35:14 (id: 1018035014)

14You are telling God that you have made your case against him but that you are still waiting for him to answer your accusations. You are saying that God has not been helping you. Since you say those things, you should certainly not expect God to respond to you!


## Job 35:15 (id: 1018035015)

15You also say that God does not pay much attention when people commit sins, and so he does not become angry and punish them.


## Job 35:16 (id: 1018035016)

16My friends, you see that Job has said things that are completely useless. He says many things without knowing what he is talking about.”


## Job 36:1 (id: 1018036001)

1Then Elihu said some more things to Job:


## Job 36:2 (id: 1018036002)

2“Job, be patient with me a little longer as I explain things to you. Be patient, because I have more to say in order to show that God does not do anything wrong.


## Job 36:3 (id: 1018036003)

3I will tell you what I have learned from many sources. I will show that God, who made me, always does what is right.


## Job 36:4 (id: 1018036004)

4You can indeed listen patiently because I will not say anything to you that is false. I am here with you as someone who understands things well.


## Job 36:5 (id: 1018036005)

5Truly, God is very powerful, but he values every person. He understands everything completely.


## Job 36:6 (id: 1018036006)

6He does not allow wicked people to remain alive, but he helps people whom others have been oppressing.


## Job 36:7 (id: 1018036007)

7He always protects people who are righteous. He makes them prosper as if they were kings, and he causes others to honor them continually.


## Job 36:8 (id: 1018036008)

8Sometimes people suffer great troubles because they have done wrong things.


## Job 36:9 (id: 1018036009)

9When they do, God shows them what they have done wrong. He shows them that they committed these sins because they were proud.


## Job 36:10 (id: 1018036010)

10He enables them to understand what he is teaching them. He commands them to stop sinning.


## Job 36:11 (id: 1018036011)

11If they obey him and once again live as he wishes, they will prosper and be happy for as long as they live.


## Job 36:12 (id: 1018036012)

12But if they do not obey him, they will die violently because they did not seek to understand how God wanted them to live.


## Job 36:13 (id: 1018036013)

13People who do not respect God continue to be angry with God. They do not ask God to help them even when they are suffering because of their sins.


## Job 36:14 (id: 1018036014)

14They can only make a living in a dishonorable way, and they die while they are still young.


## Job 36:15 (id: 1018036015)

15God actually uses suffering to keep people from perishing because of their sins. By making them suffer, he causes them to listen to what he is telling them.


## Job 36:16 (id: 1018036016)

16Job, I believe that God wants to bring you out of your troubles and allow you to live without distress. He wants you to be happy and prosperous.


## Job 36:17 (id: 1018036017)

17However, you are still saying bad things about God the way a wicked person would. That is why God is punishing you so severely.


## Job 36:18 (id: 1018036018)

18You are angry with God, but do not let that lead you to say disrespectful things about God. If you did that, God would not accept even a very large bribe to pardon you.


## Job 36:19 (id: 1018036019)

19God would not want your money and so pardon you. He would not take gold or a great deal of money as a bribe.


## Job 36:20 (id: 1018036020)

20You should not wish that you could die so that your suffering would be over. Once people die, they are gone.


## Job 36:21 (id: 1018036021)

21Be careful not to commit sin. It seems that you would rather defy God than learn what he wants to teach you through suffering.


## Job 36:22 (id: 1018036022)

22Truly, God is so powerful that he can do great things. He is better than any other teacher.


## Job 36:23 (id: 1018036023)

23No one has ever told him what he should do. No one has ever had to tell him that what he was doing was wrong.


## Job 36:24 (id: 1018036024)

24People have often sung songs to praise him. You too should remember what he has done and praise him for it.


## Job 36:25 (id: 1018036025)

25Everyone has seen what God has done, but even so, people only understand it a little.


## Job 36:26 (id: 1018036026)

26How great God is! We are not able to understand how great he is, and we are not able to determine how old he is.


## Job 36:27 (id: 1018036027)

27Indeed, God draws water up from the earth and puts it in clouds and causes it to become rain.


## Job 36:28 (id: 1018036028)

28This rain pours down from the clouds and abundant showers fall on the earth, where people live.


## Job 36:29 (id: 1018036029)

29No one can really understand how the clouds spread across the sky or how it thunders in the sky where God lives.


## Job 36:30 (id: 1018036030)

30See how God causes lightning to flash all around him! The lightning is so bright that it lights up even the deep ocean.


## Job 36:31 (id: 1018036031)

31Because his storms are so great, God uses them to punish wicked people. But he also uses the rain from these storms to provide abundant food for righteous people.


## Job 36:32 (id: 1018036032)

32It is as if God picks up lightning in his hands and sends it to strike where he wants it to.


## Job 36:33 (id: 1018036033)

33God makes thunder to announce that there will be a storm. We also know that a storm is coming when we hear cattle making extra noise.


## Job 37:1 (id: 1018037001)

1My heart really pounds when I think about that! I feel as if it is jumping around inside me.


## Job 37:2 (id: 1018037002)

2Listen, all of you, to the thunder! It is as if God is roaring!


## Job 37:3 (id: 1018037003)

3God makes such loud thunder that people can hear it throughout the land. God makes such bright lighting that people can see it from far away.


## Job 37:4 (id: 1018037004)

4After lightning flashes, we hear thunder, which sounds like God speaking very loudly. Then, after the thunder, God makes more lightning.


## Job 37:5 (id: 1018037005)

5When we hear thunder, it is as if God is shouting in an amazing way. God does things that are too wonderful for us to understand.


## Job 37:6 (id: 1018037006)

6For example, God can cause snow to cover the ground, and when he tells a rain shower to rain even harder, it becomes a downpour.


## Job 37:7 (id: 1018037007)

7When God makes it rain so hard, everyone has to stop working outside. This shows all people, whom he has made, what great things he is able to do.


## Job 37:8 (id: 1018037008)

8When it rains, the animals go into their hiding places and they stay there until the rain stops.


## Job 37:9 (id: 1018037009)

9Storms come from the place where they start, and cold winds come from the north.


## Job 37:10 (id: 1018037010)

10In the winter, cold winds turn water into ice. The water in lakes freezes solid.


## Job 37:11 (id: 1018037011)

11God truly fills the clouds with water droplets. He makes lightning flash from many clouds.


## Job 37:12 (id: 1018037012)

12He causes the clouds to move around over the places where people live so that they can accomplish everything that he wants them to do.


## Job 37:13 (id: 1018037013)

13God may send storms to punish people. God may send storms to water the land that he made. God may send storms to help people by providing rain to make their crops grow. God makes all of these things happen.


## Job 37:14 (id: 1018037014)

14Job, listen to what I am saying. Just think about the wonderful things that God does.


## Job 37:15 (id: 1018037015)

15Are you able to explain how God arranges the clouds in the sky and makes lightning flash down from them?


## Job 37:16 (id: 1018037016)

16Are you able to explain how God is able to make clouds float in the sky? Can you understand all of the wonderful things that God does? God understands everything completely!


## Job 37:17 (id: 1018037017)

17Are you able to explain how God can bring in stifling air from the desert and make it so hot that you cannot stay cool if you wear clothes?


## Job 37:18 (id: 1018037018)

18Are you able to explain how God made the sky so that it would stay firmly in place above the earth?


## Job 37:19 (id: 1018037019)

19I doubt that you could tell us what to say to God. People do not know enough to be able to defend themselves if they spoke with God.


## Job 37:20 (id: 1018037020)

20I would not dare tell God that I needed to speak with him! If I did that, then he might destroy me!


## Job 37:21 (id: 1018037021)

21You know that people can not look directly at the sun when it shines brightly in the sky after the wind has blown the clouds away.


## Job 37:22 (id: 1018037022)

22When God appears, he has glittering light all around him. His glory is so bright that it makes us afraid. {So if we cannot even look at the sun, how could we look at God?}


## Job 37:23 (id: 1018037023)

23Shaddai has very great power, and we do not know how to get near to him. He always acts righteously, and he never mistreats anyone.


## Job 37:24 (id: 1018037024)

24That is why everyone should have great respect for him. Any people who think that they are wise do not impress him.”


## Job 38:1 (id: 1018038001)

1Then Yahweh spoke to Job from inside the storm that had been approaching. He said to him,


## Job 38:2 (id: 1018038002)

2“You have been speaking ignorantly, and as a result, you have been making it harder for people to understand my actions.


## Job 38:3 (id: 1018038003)

3I am going to ask you some questions, so get ready to answer them directly.


## Job 38:4 (id: 1018038004)

4Where were you when I began to create the earth? Since you claim to know so much, tell me how I did that.


## Job 38:5 (id: 1018038005)

5Who decided how large the earth would be? Who made sure that it was the right size? If you know as much as you claim, you ought to be able to tell me that.


## Job 38:6 (id: 1018038006)

6(6\-7\) What keeps the earth from collapsing? Who made sure that everything on the earth would be in the right position? The earth was so beautiful when I made it that it was as if the first stars all sang a song to celebrate it. All of the angels gave a great cheer when they saw the earth.


## Job 38:8 (id: 1018038008)

8When I made the land, the sea could have flowed over it. Who prevented the sea from flooding the earth?


## Job 38:9 (id: 1018038009)

9Now the clouds in the sky float over the sea as if they were its clothing. Night and day happen at sea just as they do on land.


## Job 38:10 (id: 1018038010)

10I decided how much of the area under the sky the sea would cover. I made barriers at the shore of the sea to keep it off the land.


## Job 38:11 (id: 1018038011)

11I proclaimed that the sea could only come up so far on the shore and not come any farther. I said that its great waves could only flow up to a certain place on the land.


## Job 38:12 (id: 1018038012)

12Job, have you ever commanded a day to begin? Have you told the sun where it needed to rise on a certain day?


## Job 38:13 (id: 1018038013)

13When day comes, wicked people all around the world stop doing the bad things they do at night when no one can see them.


## Job 38:14 (id: 1018038014)

14In the light of day, people can see the hills and valleys on earth clearly. The earth seems to take shape the way clay takes shape when people press a seal onto it or the way folds form in clothing.


## Job 38:15 (id: 1018038015)

15When daylight comes, wicked people do not have the darkness that they like. They are no longer able to hurt other people.


## Job 38:16 (id: 1018038016)

16Job, have you traveled to the springs at the bottom of the sea? Have you gone and seen what is at the very bottom of the oceans?

19Do you know how to get to the place where light comes from? Do you know where darkness comes from?


## Job 38:20 (id: 1018038020)

20Would you know how to get to those places so that you could bring light and darkness to them?


## Job 38:21 (id: 1018038021)

21If you had been alive when I created the world, then you would know the answers to these questions. But you are not that old, so you certainly do not know the answers.


## Job 38:22 (id: 1018038022)

22Have you gone into the place where I keep snow, or have you visited the place where I keep hail?


## Job 38:23 (id: 1018038023)

23I keep snow and hail so that I can use them to defeat one of the armies when people are fighting wars.

24Would you know how to get to the place where the sun should rise each morning? Would you know where the east wind should begin to blow over the earth?


## Job 38:25 (id: 1018038025)

25Could you make rain fall in a certain place? Could you make a rainstorm go in a certain direction

26so that it would rain out in the desert, in a place where no one lives?

28Do you even know where rain comes from? Do you know how dew forms on the ground overnight?


## Job 38:29 (id: 1018038029)

29Do you know how water becomes ice in the winter? Do you know why dew turns into the frost that covers the ground in the winter?


## Job 38:30 (id: 1018038030)

30Do you know why the surface of lakes freezes in the winter? You cannot see the water below the surface; it is as if there is a layer of stone on top of it.


## Job 38:31 (id: 1018038031)

31Can you make stars cluster together, as they do in the cluster you call the Pleiades? Can you make stars move apart so that they no longer make constellations such as the one you call Orion?


## Job 38:32 (id: 1018038032)

32Can you make the constellations of stars appear in the sky at the right time of the year? Can you make the Big Dipper with its handle appear in the right place in the sky?

36Can you determine where it should be cloudy and where it should be sunny?


## Job 38:37 (id: 1018038037)

37Are you able to count how many clouds there are? Can you make it rain


## Job 38:38 (id: 1018038038)

38after it has not rained for such a long time that the ground is hard and dry?


## Job 38:39 (id: 1018038039)

39(39\-40\) Suppose a lioness and her cubs were crouching in their den or hiding in some bushes, waiting for some animal to pass by that they could kill. Could you make an animal go by that the lioness could kill so that she and her cubs could eat the meat and not be hungry anymore?


## Job 38:41 (id: 1018038041)

41Suppose some baby ravens in a nest were chirping loudly because they were hungry. Suppose they had not eaten in so long that they had become weak. Could you provide a dead animal whose meat the raven could bring home to its baby birds?


## Job 39:1 (id: 1018039001)

1Job, can you tell when female mountain goats are about to give birth? Have you watched the wild deer while their calves were being born?


## Job 39:2 (id: 1018039002)

2Do you know for how long these female animals will be pregnant? Do you know when they will have their babies?

3They crouch down to give birth, and their babies come out.


## Job 39:4 (id: 1018039004)

## Job 39:5 (id: 1018039005)

5Do you know why some donkeys wander around wild? Do you know why they are not still working for people?


## Job 39:6 (id: 1018039006)

6I have given them a home in the desert plain. They are able to live in places where much grass does not grow.


## Job 39:7 (id: 1018039007)

7These wild donkeys do not like the noise in the cities. In the desert, they do not have to listen to the shouts of those who used to force them to work.


## Job 39:8 (id: 1018039008)

8They wander over the hills to find food. They look for any plant that they can eat.


## Job 39:9 (id: 1018039009)

9There are also oxen that are wild. You could not get one of those to work for you! It would not stay penned up at night by the place where you put food for your animals!


## Job 39:10 (id: 1018039010)

10You could not make a wild ox pull a plow so that it would dig furrows in your fields.


## Job 39:11 (id: 1018039011)

11Even though a wild ox is very strong, you could not depend on it to do difficult farm work.


## Job 39:12 (id: 1018039012)

12A wild ox would not help you to grow more crops than you could grow by yourself.


## Job 39:13 (id: 1018039013)

13Now think about ostriches. They run very fast, flapping their wings as they go. But they do not take good care of their offspring.


## Job 39:14 (id: 1018039014)

14Female ostriches are bad mothers, because lay their eggs and leave them on the ground. The eggs do stay warm in the sand.


## Job 39:15 (id: 1018039015)

15But this is still not a good thing to do. Some wild animal could step on the eggs and crush them.


## Job 39:16 (id: 1018039016)

16Ostriches do not care well for their chicks. They act as if the chicks do not belong to them. They do not seem to be concerned that their chicks might die and they would have laid their eggs for nothing.


## Job 39:17 (id: 1018039017)

17Ostriches act this way because I did not give them good instincts. I did not enable them to understand how they should care for their eggs and chicks.


## Job 39:18 (id: 1018039018)

18However, ostriches are still awesome birds. When they run, they can easily run faster than horses!


## Job 39:19 (id: 1018039019)

19But I made horses to be very strong. I put beautiful flowing manes on their necks.


## Job 39:20 (id: 1018039020)

20I enabled them to leap through the air as if they were locusts. They snort so loudly that they cause people to be afraid.


## Job 39:21 (id: 1018039021)

21As horses prepare to rush into battle, they paw the ground, showing off their great strength.


## Job 39:22 (id: 1018039022)

22Horses seem to disregard danger as they go bravely into battle. They do not run away when enemy soldiers attack them.


## Job 39:23 (id: 1018039023)

23As horses run into battle, the quivers containing their riders’ arrows rattle against their sides. The spears and javelins that they are carrying flash in the sunlight.


## Job 39:24 (id: 1018039024)

24Horses rush into battle as soon as an officer blows a horn to signal that the army should advance. The horses run very quickly, and they speedily reach the enemy lines.


## Job 39:25 (id: 1018039025)

25When they hear someone blow the battle horn, horses neigh excitedly. They can smell a battle even from a distance. They hear commanders shouting orders to their soldiers {and they know the battle will begin soon}.


## Job 39:26 (id: 1018039026)

26Now think about birds that hunt small animals and other birds. Do you know how hawks are able to stay in the air as if they were floating? Do you know how they sense when it is time to fly to a warmer place for the winter?


## Job 39:27 (id: 1018039027)

27I gave eagles the ability to fly high up into the cliffs and build their nests there.


## Job 39:28 (id: 1018039028)

28Eagles live on cliffs. They are safe among the high, pointed rocks there because no animals can get to them.


## Job 39:29 (id: 1018039029)

29From that great height, eagles look for animals that they can kill and eat. They can see animals that are far away.


## Job 39:30 (id: 1018039030)

30Eagles kill small animals and bring them back to their nests to feed their chicks. Eagles also go and eat dead bodies that they see lying on the ground.”


## Job 40:1 (id: 1018040001)

1Yahweh continued to speak to Job. He said,


## Job 40:2 (id: 1018040002)

2“Do you still think I am wrong and want to keep arguing with me? If you want to keep criticizing me, then answer the questions I have asked you!”


## Job 40:3 (id: 1018040003)

3But Job replied to Yahweh,


## Job 40:4 (id: 1018040004)

4“Now I realize how insignificant I am. I am not able to answer your questions. I will not say anything in response to them.


## Job 40:5 (id: 1018040005)

5I have already said more than I should have said. So now I will say nothing more.”


## Job 40:6 (id: 1018040006)

6Then Yahweh again spoke to Job from inside the storm. He said,


## Job 40:7 (id: 1018040007)

7“I am going to ask you some more questions, so get ready to answer them directly.


## Job 40:8 (id: 1018040008)

8Do you still want to govern the universe instead of me? Do you still want to insist that I am doing things wrong and that you would do them right?


## Job 40:9 (id: 1018040009)

9Do you have the same amount of power as I do? Does your voice sound as loud as thunder, as mine does?


## Job 40:10 (id: 1018040010)

10If you want to govern the universe, you must show that you are dignified and noble. You must show that your character is glorious and beautiful.


## Job 40:11 (id: 1018040011)

11You must express holy wrath against the people who deserve it. You must recognize which people are being sinfully arrogant and take them out of important positions.


## Job 40:12 (id: 1018040012)

12Yes, you must not allow arrogant people to remain in important positions. Destroy wicked people quickly!


## Job 40:13 (id: 1018040013)

13Punish all of them by killing them. Then send them to the place where dead people go.


## Job 40:14 (id: 1018040014)

14If you did that, I would congratulate you and admit that you could save yourself by your own ability.


## Job 40:15 (id: 1018040015)

15{But to show you how insignificant you really are,} I want you to think about a great animal that I created, Behemoth. I made you, and I also made it. Even though this great beast has the size and strength to hunt and kill other animals, it eats plants as oxen do.


## Job 40:16 (id: 1018040016)

16Think about how strong the legs of Behemoth are! And the muscles in its belly are very powerful.


## Job 40:17 (id: 1018040017)

17Behemoth can make its tail as stiff as the branch of a cedar tree and hold it up in the air. It has very strong legs.


## Job 40:18 (id: 1018040018)

18Its thigh bones are so strong that they are like tubes made of bronze. Its legs are so strong that they are like bars made of iron.


## Job 40:19 (id: 1018040019)

19Behemoth is one of the strongest animals that I made. I gave it sharp tusks so that it could cut down plants and eat them.


## Job 40:20 (id: 1018040020)

20It needs those tusks because it comes out of the river where it lives in order to eat the plants that grow nearby. But other animals do not have to be afraid of it, so those animals do not run away or hide.


## Job 40:21 (id: 1018040021)

21Behemoth lies under the trees that grow near the river where it lives. It sometimes shelters in the tall reeds that grow in the swamps of the river.


## Job 40:22 (id: 1018040022)

22Behemoth stays in the shade of trees that grow near the river. It stays in the midst of the trees that grow near the water.


## Job 40:23 (id: 1018040023)

23Even when the river in which it lives become strong and turbulent, this does not disturb Behemoth. It does not mind even if the level of the water in the river rises very high.


## Job 40:24 (id: 1018040024)

24No one could capture Behemoth even if he could get close enough to stand right in front of it. No one can make Behemoth a tame animal.


## Job 41:1 (id: 1018041001)

1{And now I want you to think about another great animal that I created, Leviathan.} You cannot catch Leviathan with a fishhook, and you cannot tie rope around its jaws to hold them closed!


## Job 41:2 (id: 1018041002)

2You cannot hook its jaws to catch it and then put cords through its nose to control it.


## Job 41:3 (id: 1018041003)

3Leviathan would certainly not plead with you to act mercifully toward it! It would not use sweet talk to try to get you not to harm it!


## Job 41:4 (id: 1018041004)

4Leviathan would certainly not make an agreement to work for you as your slave for as long as it lived!


## Job 41:5 (id: 1018041005)

5You could not turn it into a pet, as people do with birds! You could not put a leash around its neck so that the young women in your household could take it for walks!


## Job 41:6 (id: 1018041006)

6People who work together to catch fish could never catch Leviathan and then decide what share of it belonged to each of them. They would never get the chance to cut Leviathan into pieces and then sell its meat!


## Job 41:7 (id: 1018041007)

7People cannot throw harpoons hard enough at Leviathan to pierce its hide! People cannot throw fishing spears into its head!


## Job 41:8 (id: 1018041008)

8If you try to fight with Leviathan, it will give you a battle that you will never forget! You will never try to do that again!


## Job 41:9 (id: 1018041009)

9It is useless even to hope to subdue Leviathan. Just the sight of it is enough to make a person become so afraid that he falls down.


## Job 41:10 (id: 1018041010)

10No one is so foolhardy that he would wake up Leviathan if it were sleeping. {It would angrily attack him.} Since that is true, it is even more foolhardy to challenge me{, as you have done}.


## Job 41:11 (id: 1018041011)

11{Even if people are righteous,} they have not done anything for me that obligates me to make only good things happen to them. Everything in the created world belongs to me{, so no one can give me anything that I have to repay.}


## Job 41:12 (id: 1018041012)

12And now I want to speak to you further. {You said that you wanted to wake up Leviathan! As I said, that would be very foolish.} It has agile legs and great strength and a graceful shape.


## Job 41:13 (id: 1018041013)

13It has a tough hide that no one can strip off. It has powerful jaws.


## Job 41:14 (id: 1018041014)

14Those jaws have terrible teeth in them! No one can pry them open when they are closed{, and no one can release them when they bite onto something.}


## Job 41:15 (id: 1018041015)

15It has rows of scales on its back with no gaps between them.


## Job 41:16 (id: 1018041016)

16Those scales are so close together that it seems as if not even air can get between them.


## Job 41:17 (id: 1018041017)

17Those scales join very closely to each other and they do not pull apart.


## Job 41:18 (id: 1018041018)

18When Leviathan makes a loud sound, fire comes out of its mouth as well as noise. It has bright, scary eyes that seem to glow with fire.


## Job 41:19 (id: 1018041019)

19When it breathes, it shoots out flames and fiery sparks.


## Job 41:20 (id: 1018041020)

20Smoke pours out of its nostrils the way steam pours out of a pot of boiling water over a hot fire.


## Job 41:21 (id: 1018041021)

21Flames shoot out from its mouth, so when it breathes on wood, the wood catches fire.


## Job 41:22 (id: 1018041022)

22Its neck is very strong. Wherever it goes, it makes people very afraid.


## Job 41:23 (id: 1018041023)

23Leviathan does not have a soft belly as other animals do. Scales wrap around its belly and hold it tightly to its body.


## Job 41:24 (id: 1018041024)

24It does not feel any compassion, any more than a stone would feel compassion or the lower millstone on which people grind grain would feel compassion.


## Job 41:25 (id: 1018041025)

25When Leviathan rises up out of the ocean, the bravest people become terrified. When sailors see it churning up the water, they sail away as fast as they can.


## Job 41:26 (id: 1018041026)

26People cannot injure it with swords. They cannot injure it with spears, arrows, or other weapons that have sharp points, either.


## Job 41:27 (id: 1018041027)

27An iron weapon could not hurt it any more than straw could. A bronze weapon could not hurt it any more than a weapon made of rotten wood.


## Job 41:28 (id: 1018041028)

28Shooting arrows at it does not cause it to flee. Hurling stones at it from a sling is like hurling bits of chaff at it.


## Job 41:29 (id: 1018041029)

29A club that someone might use against it would not hurt it any more than chaff would. It can ignore any spear that someone might throw at it.


## Job 41:30 (id: 1018041030)

30Scales as sharp as broken pieces of pottery cover its belly. When it drags itself through the mud, these scales tear up the ground.


## Job 41:31 (id: 1018041031)

31As it swims through the deep water of the ocean, it churns it into foam, as if it were boiling water or ointment that someone was stirring.


## Job 41:32 (id: 1018041032)

32As it swims through the water, it creates a glistening wake. The churning water is like white hair on top of the deep sea.


## Job 41:33 (id: 1018041033)

33There is nothing in the world like Leviathan. I created it in such a way that it would not be afraid of anything.


## Job 41:34 (id: 1018041034)

34Nothing else scares it, no matter how powerful that thing may be. It is greater than the greatest of other creatures.”


## Job 42:1 (id: 1018042001)

1Then Job replied to Yahweh. He said,


## Job 42:2 (id: 1018042002)

2“Now I realize that you can do anything you want. No one can stop you from doing what you want to do.


## Job 42:3 (id: 1018042003)

3You told me that I had been speaking ignorantly, and that as a result, I was making it harder for people to understand your actions. I will admit that I was speaking about things that I did not understand. Those things were very amazing, and I did not really know what I was talking about.


## Job 42:4 (id: 1018042004)

4You told me that I should listen and let you talk because you were going to ask me some questions. You wanted me to try to answer them. {But I will admit that I am not able to answer the questions you asked.}


## Job 42:5 (id: 1018042005)

5I had previously heard many things about you. But now I have actually seen you!


## Job 42:6 (id: 1018042006)

6Therefore I am ashamed of myself for what I said. I am sitting in dust and ashes to show that I am sorry for what I said.”


## Job 42:7 (id: 1018042007)

7When Yahweh had finished speaking with Job, he spoke to Eliphaz, Job's friend from the town of Teman. He said, “I am very angry with you and your two friends. I am angry because you did not say true things about me the way Job did. He serves me faithfully.


## Job 42:8 (id: 1018042008)

8So now you must bring seven young bulls and seven rams to Job, that man who serves me faithfully. While he is with you, kill these animals and burn them as a sacrifice for yourselves. Then Job will pray for you, and I will do what he asks me to do for you. I will not punish you for speaking foolishly about me. You deserve for me to punish you because you did not say the right things about me as Job did. He serves me faithfully.”


## Job 42:9 (id: 1018042009)

9So Eliphaz, Job's friend from the town of Teman; Bildad, Job's friend from the Shuhite people group; and Zophar, Job's friend from the town of Naamah, did what Yahweh had commanded them to do. Then Job prayed for his friends, and Yahweh forgave them as Job asked him to do.


## Job 42:10 (id: 1018042010)

10After Job had prayed for his three friends, Yahweh healed him and made him wealthy again. Yahweh gave him twice as much wealth as he had before.


## Job 42:11 (id: 1018042011)

11Then Job's family and friends came to his house and had a feast with him. All of his brothers and sisters came, and all of his former acquaintances also came. They cheered him up now that all of the troubles were over that Yahweh had allowed to happen to him. Each of them gave Job a valuable piece of silver and a gold earring.


## Job 42:12 (id: 1018042012)

12Yahweh blessed Job more in the second part of his life than he had blessed him in the first part of his life. Job acquired 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 pairs of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.


## Job 42:13 (id: 1018042013)

13Job also had seven more sons and three more daughters.


## Job 42:14 (id: 1018042014)

14He named the first daughter Jemimah. He named the second daughter Keziah. And he named the third daughter Keren Happuch.


## Job 42:15 (id: 1018042015)

15Job's three daughters were the most beautiful women in the whole land of Uz. As their father, Job declared that his daughters would each receive an inheritance from him, just as their brothers would.


## Job 42:16 (id: 1018042016)

16After God restored Job's prosperity, he lived for 140 more years. His new children had children of their own. Then his grandchildren had children of their own, so Job was even able to get to know his great\-grandchildren.


## Job 42:17 (id: 1018042017)

17Job finally died after living a good long life.
