## Deuteronomy 1:1 (id: 1005001001)

1In this book are speeches that Moses said to all the Israelites. He spoke to them after they had set up their tents east of the Jordan River. They were in the desert plain along the Jordan near a place named Suph. Suph is between Paran {on one side of the Jordan River} and the towns of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab {on the other side of the river}.


## Deuteronomy 1:2 (id: 1005001002)

2It usually takes 11 days to walk from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea. People go by way of the hilly area called Edom.


## Deuteronomy 1:3 (id: 1005001003)

3Forty years had passed since the Israelites had left Egypt, and it was the first day of the eleventh month. Moses told the Israelite people everything that Yahweh had commanded him to tell them.


## Deuteronomy 1:4 (id: 1005001004)

4He did this after they had defeated Sihon and Og. Sihon, the king of the Amor people group, lived in the city of Heshbon. Og, the king of the region of Bashan, lived in the towns of Ashtaroth and Edrei.


## Deuteronomy 1:5 (id: 1005001005)

5The people were in Moab, on the east side of the Jordan River. There, Moses explained to them God’s instructions, saying:


## Deuteronomy 1:6 (id: 1005001006)

6“Yahweh our God said to our ancestors at Mount Sinai, ‘You have stayed for a very long time at the base of this mountain.


## Deuteronomy 1:7 (id: 1005001007)

7Now you must continue traveling. Go to the hilly area where the Amor people group lives and go to the nearby areas. These areas include the plain along the Jordan, the hilly area, the smaller hills in the west, the wilderness in the south, the Mediterranean seacoast, the land of Canaan, the Lebanon mountains, and northeast to the great Euphrates River.


## Deuteronomy 1:8 (id: 1005001008)

8Be assured that I will give that land to you. I, Yahweh, promised the land to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I promised that I would give it to them and to their descendants. So go and occupy it.’


## Deuteronomy 1:9 (id: 1005001009)

9I said to your families when we were at Mount Sinai, ‘I am not able to govern all of you by myself.


## Deuteronomy 1:10 (id: 1005001010)

10Yahweh our God has caused us Israelites to become numerous. Today we are as numerous as the stars in the sky.


## Deuteronomy 1:11 (id: 1005001011)

11I pray that Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped, will cause us to become a great many times more numerous than we are now. I pray that he will bless us just as he promised to do.


## Deuteronomy 1:12 (id: 1005001012)

12But I cannot solve all of your problems by myself.


## Deuteronomy 1:13 (id: 1005001013)

13So choose some men from your tribes who are wise and who have good sense and whom people respect. Then I will assign them to be your leaders.’


## Deuteronomy 1:14 (id: 1005001014)

14Your parents replied, ‘We agree with what you have suggested.’


## Deuteronomy 1:15 (id: 1005001015)

15So I took the wise men, those whom people respected and whom your families chose from your tribes, and I appointed them to be your leaders. I appointed some to lead groups of 1, 000 people, some to lead groups of 100 people, some to lead groups of 50 people, and some to lead groups of 10 people. I also appointed other officers from throughout your tribes.


## Deuteronomy 1:16 (id: 1005001016)

16Then, I instructed your leaders, ‘Listen when your people are quarreling. Consider each case fairly, including cases where Israelites quarrel with each other. Also consider cases where an Israelite quarrels with someone from another land who lives among you.


## Deuteronomy 1:17 (id: 1005001017)

17You must not favor one person more than another. You must treat poor people and important people equally. You must not worry about what anyone will think, because you will decide matters as God wants you to decide them. If you are not sure what to decide when people are quarreling, tell me, and I will decide.’


## Deuteronomy 1:18 (id: 1005001018)

18At that time I also told you other things that you should do.


## Deuteronomy 1:19 (id: 1005001019)

19Then, just as Yahweh our God told us to do, we left Mount Sinai. We went through a huge and dangerous wilderness. The wilderness was on the road to the hilly area where the Amor people group lives. We arrived at Kadesh Barnea.


## Deuteronomy 1:20 (id: 1005001020)

20I said to your parents, ‘You have now come to the hilly area where the Amor people group lives. This is part of the area that Yahweh our God is giving to us.


## Deuteronomy 1:21 (id: 1005001021)

21Be assured that Yahweh our God is giving this land to us. So go and occupy it as he commanded. Yahweh is the God whom your ancestors worshiped. Do not be at all afraid.’


## Deuteronomy 1:22 (id: 1005001022)

22But your fathers all came to me and said, ‘Before we go, we should first send some men to explore the land. Then, they can return and tell us which will be the best road to go there and what kind of towns are there.’


## Deuteronomy 1:23 (id: 1005001023)

23I thought that what they had planned was good, so I chose 12 men, one man from each tribe.


## Deuteronomy 1:24 (id: 1005001024)

24They went into the hilly area as far as the Eshkol Valley, and they explored the area.


## Deuteronomy 1:25 (id: 1005001025)

25They picked some of the fruit that they found there and brought it to us. They reported that the land that Yahweh our God was giving to us was very good.


## Deuteronomy 1:26 (id: 1005001026)

26But your parents refused to go and conquer that land. They rebelled against what Yahweh our God had commanded them to do.


## Deuteronomy 1:27 (id: 1005001027)

27Your parents stayed in their tents and complained. They said, ‘Yahweh hates us, so he has brought us here from Egypt to allow the Amor people group to destroy us.


## Deuteronomy 1:28 (id: 1005001028)

28We do not want to go there. The men whom we sent there have caused us to become very afraid. They have told us that the people there are stronger and bigger than we are. They said that there are very high walls around their towns. They also said that they saw giants there that are descendants of Anak.’


## Deuteronomy 1:29 (id: 1005001029)

29Then I said to your fathers, ‘Do not be even a little bit afraid of those people!


## Deuteronomy 1:30 (id: 1005001030)

30Yahweh our God will protect you. He will fight for you just as you saw him do for you in Egypt


## Deuteronomy 1:31 (id: 1005001031)

31and in the wilderness. You saw how he brought you safely here, just like a man holds and protects his son.’


## Deuteronomy 1:32 (id: 1005001032)

32Your parents would not trust Yahweh our God, even though I reminded them of what Yahweh had done.


## Deuteronomy 1:33 (id: 1005001033)

33He always went ahead of them while they traveled in the desert. He showed them places to set up their tents. He directed them with the fire during the night and with the cloud during the day.


## Deuteronomy 1:34 (id: 1005001034)

34Yahweh heard your parents complaining, and he became angry. He solemnly declared,


## Deuteronomy 1:35 (id: 1005001035)

35(35\-36\) ‘Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will enter the land. He has obeyed me completely. So I will give to him and to his descendants some of the land that he explored. None of the rest of these evil people will ever live in that good land that I solemnly promised to give to your ancestors.’


## Deuteronomy 1:37 (id: 1005001037)

37But because of what your fathers did, Yahweh was also angry with me. He said to me, ‘You also will not enter that land.


## Deuteronomy 1:38 (id: 1005001038)

38Joshua son of Nun, who is your helper, will enter it. Support him, because he will enable the Israelite people to occupy that land.’


## Deuteronomy 1:39 (id: 1005001039)

39Yahweh continued to declare, ‘You said that your enemies would capture your children, {but this did not happen}. Your children are very young, so they do not yet know what is good and what is evil. However, they are the ones who will enter that land. I will give them the land, and they will occupy it.


## Deuteronomy 1:40 (id: 1005001040)

40As for you, turn around and go back into the desert, toward the Red Sea.’


## Deuteronomy 1:41 (id: 1005001041)

41Then your fathers replied, ‘We have sinned by disobeying Yahweh. So we will go and attack the people who live in that land, just as Yahweh our God has told us to do.’ Then each of their men equipped himself with weapons. They thought that it would be easy to invade the hill country.


## Deuteronomy 1:42 (id: 1005001042)

42But Yahweh said to me, ‘Tell them not to go there and attack those people, because I will not help them. If they go, their enemy will certainly defeat them.’


## Deuteronomy 1:43 (id: 1005001043)

43So I said that to your fathers, but they did not obey what I said. They again rebelled against what Yahweh commanded them to do. Their soldiers proudly marched up into that hilly area.


## Deuteronomy 1:44 (id: 1005001044)

44Then the men of the Amor people group who lived in that region came out of their towns. They attacked those soldiers. They chased our soldiers like a swarm of bees would chase a person. The Amor people pursued your ancestors’ soldiers south from the Edom area and defeated them at the city of Hormah.


## Deuteronomy 1:45 (id: 1005001045)

45So your fathers went back to Kadesh Barnea and cried out to request Yahweh to help them, but he did not pay any attention to them.


## Deuteronomy 1:46 (id: 1005001046)

46So we stayed there at Kadesh Barnea for a long time.


## Deuteronomy 2:1 (id: 1005002001)

1Then we turned around and went through the desert toward the Red Sea as Yahweh told us to do. We wandered in Edom for many years.


## Deuteronomy 2:2 (id: 1005002002)

2Then Yahweh said to me,


## Deuteronomy 2:3 (id: 1005002003)

3‘You have been wandering around this hilly area for a long enough time. Now turn and travel toward the north.


## Deuteronomy 2:4 (id: 1005002004)

4And tell the people that they are about to travel near the land that belongs to the descendants of Esau, {who are also descendants of Isaac}, as you are. They live in the hilly area of Edom. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.


## Deuteronomy 2:5 (id: 1005002005)

5Do not start to fight against them, because I am not going to give you even a tiny bit of their land. That is because I have given that land to the descendants of Esau.


## Deuteronomy 2:6 (id: 1005002006)

6{When you travel near their land}, buy food and water from them.’


## Deuteronomy 2:7 (id: 1005002007)

7Remember that Yahweh our God has blessed you in everything that you have done. He knows {what has happened to you} while you have wandered in this huge desert. Yahweh our God has protected you during those 40 years, and as a result you have had everything that you needed.


## Deuteronomy 2:8 (id: 1005002008)

8So we continued to travel. We avoided going through the hilly area where the descendants of Esau, who are also descendants of Isaac, live. We turned from the road {that goes along} the plain of the Jordan valley, and {comes up} from the city of Elath and the city of Ezion Geber. We traveled along the wilderness road of the kingdom of Moab.


## Deuteronomy 2:9 (id: 1005002009)

9Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not bother the people of Moab. And do not start to fight against them, because I am not going to give you any of their land. The reason is that they are descendants of Lot. I gave them the city of Ar, {their capital, and the other areas in that country}.’”


## Deuteronomy 2:10 (id: 1005002010)

10(A people group called the Emites formerly lived there. They were as populous and tall as the descendants of Anak.


## Deuteronomy 2:11 (id: 1005002011)

11People also call both them and the descendants of Anak the Rapha people. The people of Moab call them Emites.


## Deuteronomy 2:12 (id: 1005002012)

12The Hor people group also formerly lived in the Edom area, but the descendants of Esau expelled them. They killed them and settled in their land, just as the Israelite people later expelled their enemies from the land that Yahweh gave to them.)


## Deuteronomy 2:13 (id: 1005002013)

13“Then we crossed the Zered Gorge, as Yahweh told us to do.


## Deuteronomy 2:14 (id: 1005002014)

14It had been 38 years from the time we first left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Gorge. During those years, all the Israelite fighting men of that generation died, as Yahweh had solemnly said would happen.


## Deuteronomy 2:15 (id: 1005002015)

15Furthermore, Yahweh opposed them, so he caused them to die.


## Deuteronomy 2:16 (id: 1005002016)

16After all the men who had been old enough to fight had died,


## Deuteronomy 2:17 (id: 1005002017)

17Yahweh said to me,


## Deuteronomy 2:18 (id: 1005002018)

18‘Today you must travel through the region of Moab, near Ar, their city.


## Deuteronomy 2:19 (id: 1005002019)

19When you come near the border of the land where the Ammon people group live, do not bother them or start to fight against them. The reason is that they are also descendants of Lot, so I am not going to give you any of the land that I have given to them.’


## Deuteronomy 2:20 (id: 1005002020)

20(People also call that region the land of the Rapha people, who formerly lived there. The Ammon people group call them the Zamzum group.


## Deuteronomy 2:21 (id: 1005002021)

21They were as populous and tall as the descendants of Anak. But Yahweh caused them to die when the Ammon people group expelled them and settled in their land.


## Deuteronomy 2:22 (id: 1005002022)

22Yahweh had done the same thing for the descendants of Esau living in the hilly area of Edom. He caused the Hor people group to die when the Edom people group expelled them and settled in their land. The Edom people group still lives there.


## Deuteronomy 2:23 (id: 1005002023)

23As for the Av people group, they lived in towns as far {south} as Gaza. The Caphtor people group from the island of Crete killed the Av people group and settled in their land.)


## Deuteronomy 2:24 (id: 1005002024)

24After we had gone through the region of Moab, Yahweh said to us, ‘Now cross the Arnon River. Be assured that I will help you to defeat the army of Sihon. Sihon is the king of the Amor people group, who lives in the city of Heshbon. So attack their army and start to take their land from them.


## Deuteronomy 2:25 (id: 1005002025)

25Today I will begin to frighten everyone, everywhere on your behalf. Then, everyone who hears about you will be very afraid of you.’


## Deuteronomy 2:26 (id: 1005002026)

26Then I sent messengers to go from where we were in the Desert of Kedemoth to King Sihon at Heshbon. {I told them to give him} this peaceful message:


## Deuteronomy 2:27 (id: 1005002027)

27‘Please allow us to travel through your land. {We promise that} we will stay on the road. We will not turn off to the right or to the left.


## Deuteronomy 2:28 (id: 1005002028)

28We will pay you for food and water. We want only to walk through your land


## Deuteronomy 2:29 (id: 1005002029)

29until we cross the Jordan River into the land that Yahweh our God is giving to us. Do for us just as the descendants of Esau who live in the Edom area and the Moab people group who live in the city of Ar did {for us when they allowed us to go through their land.}’


## Deuteronomy 2:30 (id: 1005002030)

30But King Sihon of Heshbon would not allow us to go through his country. That is because Yahweh our God caused him to be stubborn so that Yahweh could cause us to defeat his army and take his land, in which we still live.


## Deuteronomy 2:31 (id: 1005002031)

31Yahweh said to me, ‘Be assured that I am starting to allow you to defeat Sihon’s army and to take the people’s land from them. So start to occupy it!’


## Deuteronomy 2:32 (id: 1005002032)

32Then Sihon and his soldiers marched out to fight against us at the town of Jahaz.


## Deuteronomy 2:33 (id: 1005002033)

33But Yahweh our God caused us to defeat them. We killed Sihon, his sons, and all his soldiers.


## Deuteronomy 2:34 (id: 1005002034)

34We captured and destroyed all of King Sihon’s cities. {We killed} the men, women, and children. We did not allow any of them to remain alive.


## Deuteronomy 2:35 (id: 1005002035)

35However, we did take the livestock and valuable things from the cities that we captured.


## Deuteronomy 2:36 (id: 1005002036)

36Yahweh our God caused us to capture all their towns from the city of Aroer in the south, which is at the edge of the Arnon River Valley, to the region of Gilead in the north. Some of their cities had walls around them, but we were still able to capture them.


## Deuteronomy 2:37 (id: 1005002037)

37But we did not go near the area where the Ammon people group lives, the banks of the Jabbok River, the towns of the hilly area, or any other place where Yahweh our God told us not to go.


## Deuteronomy 3:1 (id: 1005003001)

1Then we turned north and went toward the region of Bashan. Og, the king of that area, and all his soldiers marched south to fight against us at the city of Edrei.


## Deuteronomy 3:2 (id: 1005003002)

2Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, because I will cause your army to defeat him and all his army. I will also cause you to capture all their land. Do to him what you did to Sihon, the king of the Amor people group, who ruled in the city of Heshbon.’


## Deuteronomy 3:3 (id: 1005003003)

3So Yahweh our God caused us to defeat King Og and his soldiers. We killed them all. We did not allow any of them to remain alive.


## Deuteronomy 3:4 (id: 1005003004)

4There were 60 cities in that region of Argob, in King Og’s kingdom of Bashan, but we captured all of them.


## Deuteronomy 3:5 (id: 1005003005)

5All those cities had high walls around them with gates and bars. We also captured many villages that did not have walls around them.


## Deuteronomy 3:6 (id: 1005003006)

6We completely destroyed those cities, just as we had done in the area that King Sihon ruled. We killed all the men, women, and children.


## Deuteronomy 3:7 (id: 1005003007)

7But from those cities we took for ourselves all the livestock and valuable things.


## Deuteronomy 3:8 (id: 1005003008)

8So at that time we took all the land from those two kings of the Amor people group. We took the land east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon River Valley in the south to Mount Hermon in the north.”


## Deuteronomy 3:9 (id: 1005003009)

9(The people of Sidon city call that mountain Sirion. The Amor people group call it Senir.)


## Deuteronomy 3:10 (id: 1005003010)

10“We captured all the towns on the plateau and all the region of Gilead. We also captured all of Bashan as far east as the cities of Salekah and Edrei, which also belonged to Og’s kingdom.”


## Deuteronomy 3:11 (id: 1005003011)

11(Og was the last king who was a descendant of the Rapha people. His bed was made of iron. It was four meters long and two meters wide, according to the standard measurement. It was in the city of Rabbah in the region of Ammon.)


## Deuteronomy 3:12 (id: 1005003012)

12“From the land that we captured at that time, I allotted to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the land north of the city of Aroer near the Arnon River. I also allotted to them some of the hilly areas of Gilead, along with the nearby cities.


## Deuteronomy 3:13 (id: 1005003013)

13The other part of Gilead and all of Bashan, which was the region of Argob that King Og had ruled, I allotted to half of the tribe of Manasseh.” (People call the entire region of Bashan the land of the Rapha people.)


## Deuteronomy 3:14 (id: 1005003014)

14“Jair, a man from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered all of Bashan as far north as the border of the Geshur and Maacath territories. He gave his own name to the villages there. {People still call them} the villages of Jair.


## Deuteronomy 3:15 (id: 1005003015)

15The northern part of the Gilead region I allotted to the Machir clan, {who are descendants of the tribe of Manasseh}.


## Deuteronomy 3:16 (id: 1005003016)

16I allotted to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the southern part of Gilead, extending south to the Arnon River. The middle of the river is the southern boundary. The northern boundary is the Jabbok River, which is part of the border of the region of Ammon.


## Deuteronomy 3:17 (id: 1005003017)

17The border extends from the plain along the east side of the Jordan valley, from Kinnereth in the north {(known as the Sea of Galilee)} to the Sea of Arabah (known as the Dead Sea) in the south and to the slopes of Mount Pisgah on the east.


## Deuteronomy 3:18 (id: 1005003018)

18At that time, I told you three tribes, ‘Yahweh our God is giving you this land east of the Jordan River. So now, your soldiers must cross the Jordan River ahead of the men from the other Israelite tribes. {Help them to conquer the land}.


## Deuteronomy 3:19 (id: 1005003019)

19But your wives and children and your very numerous cattle must stay in the towns that I have allotted to you.


## Deuteronomy 3:20 (id: 1005003020)

20{Your men must help} your fellow Israelites until Yahweh enables them to live there peacefully. Help them capture all the land that Yahweh our God is giving to them on the west side of the Jordan River, just like he did for you {here on the east side of the river}. After that, you all may return to this land that I have allotted to you.’


## Deuteronomy 3:21 (id: 1005003021)

21And I told Joshua, ‘You have seen everything that Yahweh our God did to those two kings, Sihon and Og. He will do the same thing to the people who are now in the land that you will be entering.


## Deuteronomy 3:22 (id: 1005003022)

22Do not be afraid of those people, because Yahweh our God is the one who will fight on your behalf.’


## Deuteronomy 3:23 (id: 1005003023)

23At that time, I earnestly prayed,


## Deuteronomy 3:24 (id: 1005003024)

24‘Yahweh our Lord, you have merely begun to show me that you are very great and that you can do powerful things. There is certainly no god in heaven or on earth who can do the powerful things that you have done.


## Deuteronomy 3:25 (id: 1005003025)

25So please allow me to cross the Jordan River. Let me see the good land on the west side, the good hilly area, and the mountains in Lebanon.’


## Deuteronomy 3:26 (id: 1005003026)

26But Yahweh was angry with me because of what your parents had done. He would not pay attention to me. Instead, he said, ‘That is enough {talk} from you! Do not talk to me about that again!


## Deuteronomy 3:27 (id: 1005003027)

27Climb up to the top of Mount Pisgah. Then look toward the west, east, north, and south. Look at it all carefully because you will not cross the Jordan River {to see the land from there}.


## Deuteronomy 3:28 (id: 1005003028)

28But tell Joshua what he must do. Encourage him because he is the one who will lead the people across the river. He will lead them to occupy the land that you will see {from the top of the mountain}.’


## Deuteronomy 3:29 (id: 1005003029)

29So we remained in the {Jordan River} valley close to the town of Beth Peor.


## Deuteronomy 4:1 (id: 1005004001)

1Now, you Israelite people, obey all the rules and regulations that I will teach you. If you do that, you will remain alive. You will be able to enter and occupy the land that Yahweh, the God whom your ancestors worshiped, is giving to you.


## Deuteronomy 4:2 (id: 1005004002)

2Do not change the words of my commands to you. Obey all the commands of Yahweh our God that I am giving to you.


## Deuteronomy 4:3 (id: 1005004003)

3You have seen what Yahweh did at Baal Peor, for example, when he destroyed all the people who worshiped {the god} Baal there.


## Deuteronomy 4:4 (id: 1005004004)

4However, all of you who faithfully continued to worship Yahweh our God are still alive today.


## Deuteronomy 4:5 (id: 1005004005)

5Never forget that I have taught you all the rules and regulations, just as Yahweh our God told me to do. He wants you to obey them {when you are living} in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.


## Deuteronomy 4:6 (id: 1005004006)

6Obey them faithfully because, if you do that, you will show the people of other nations that you are very wise. When they hear about all these rules, they will say, ‘The people of this great nation of Israel are certainly very wise!’


## Deuteronomy 4:7 (id: 1005004007)

7Even if other nations are great, there is none of them that has a god who cares for them as Yahweh our God cares for us!


## Deuteronomy 4:8 (id: 1005004008)

8And there is no other nation, even if it is a great nation, which has laws that are as just as the laws that I am speaking to you today.


## Deuteronomy 4:9 (id: 1005004009)

9But be very careful! Do not forget what you have seen God do. Remember those things as long as you are alive. Tell them to your children and your grandchildren.


## Deuteronomy 4:10 (id: 1005004010)

10Tell them about the day that your parents stood in the presence of Yahweh our God at Mount Sinai, when he said to me, ‘Gather the people together in order that they can hear what I say. I want them to learn to respect me and honor me as long as they are alive. I want them to teach their children to do the same.’


## Deuteronomy 4:11 (id: 1005004011)

11Tell your children that your parents came near to the foot of the mountain while the mountain burned with a fire that went up to the sky, and the mountain was covered with darkness, clouds, and smoke.


## Deuteronomy 4:12 (id: 1005004012)

12Then Yahweh spoke to your parents out of the middle of the fire. Your parents only heard him speak, but they did not see him.


## Deuteronomy 4:13 (id: 1005004013)

13And he declared to them his covenant that he wants you also to obey. He gave them the Ten Commandments. He wrote those on two stone tablets.


## Deuteronomy 4:14 (id: 1005004014)

14Yahweh told me to teach all the rules and regulations to you in order that you would obey them. He wants you to obey them in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.


## Deuteronomy 4:15 (id: 1005004015)

15On the day that Yahweh spoke to your parents at Mount Sinai, they did not see him. So be very careful!


## Deuteronomy 4:16 (id: 1005004016)

16Do not sin by making for yourselves any carved figure! Do not make anything that resembles the likeness of anything: man, woman,


## Deuteronomy 4:17 (id: 1005004017)

17any animal, any bird,


## Deuteronomy 4:18 (id: 1005004018)

18any reptile, or any fish.


## Deuteronomy 4:19 (id: 1005004019)

19Do not look up toward the sky and be tempted to worship anything that you see there—the sun or the moon or the stars. Yahweh our God has given those to {help} all people everywhere.


## Deuteronomy 4:20 (id: 1005004020)

20Yahweh has brought your families out of Egypt, where they were suffering as though they were in a blazing furnace. That is so that they would be people who belong to him, which is what you are today.


## Deuteronomy 4:21 (id: 1005004021)

21But Yahweh was angry with me because of what your parents did. He declared that I would never enter the land that he is giving to you.


## Deuteronomy 4:22 (id: 1005004022)

22He swore that I would die here in this land and never cross the Jordan River. But you will go across it, and you will occupy that land.


## Deuteronomy 4:23 (id: 1005004023)

23Be sure that you do not forget the covenant that Yahweh our God made with you, and do not make a carved figure in the likeness of anything about which he has forbidden you.


## Deuteronomy 4:24 (id: 1005004024)

24This is because Yahweh your God wants everyone to worship him alone. He will destroy anyone who worships idols.


## Deuteronomy 4:25 (id: 1005004025)

25When you have been in the land of Canaan for a long time and you have children and grandchildren, do not sin by making a carved figure that represents anything. Yahweh says that is evil, and if you do that, you will cause him to become angry.


## Deuteronomy 4:26 (id: 1005004026)

26Today I am requesting everyone who is in heaven and earth to watch what you are doing. But {if you disobey what I am telling you}, you will soon all die in the land that you will be crossing the Jordan River to occupy. You will not live very long there, because Yahweh will get rid of you.


## Deuteronomy 4:27 (id: 1005004027)

27Yahweh will force the rest of you to go and live among the people of many other nations. Only a few of you will survive there.


## Deuteronomy 4:28 (id: 1005004028)

28When you are in those nations, you will worship gods that are made by humans from wood and stone. {They will be gods} that cannot see, hear, eat, or smell {anything}.


## Deuteronomy 4:29 (id: 1005004029)

29But while you are there, you will try to know Yahweh your God. If you try as much as you can to know him, he will answer you.


## Deuteronomy 4:30 (id: 1005004030)

30In the future, when you are being mistreated {there} and all those {bad} things happen to you, you will again worship only Yahweh and obey him.


## Deuteronomy 4:31 (id: 1005004031)

31Yahweh is a God who acts mercifully. {If you obey him}, he will not abandon you, cause you to die, or forget the agreement that he solemnly made with your ancestors.


## Deuteronomy 4:32 (id: 1005004032)

32Now please think about the past, about the time before you were born, about all the time since God first created people here on the earth. You could search everywhere. Certainly, nothing has ever happened that is as great {as what Yahweh did for the Israelite people}.


## Deuteronomy 4:33 (id: 1005004033)

33Certainly no group has ever remained alive after they heard their God speak to them from the middle of a fire like we did.


## Deuteronomy 4:34 (id: 1005004034)

34Certainly God has never before tried to take a huge group of people from one nation {to another location} as he did for us when he brought us out of Egypt. We saw Yahweh our God use his power when he performed miracles, sent plagues, terrified people, and fought the Egyptians for us.


## Deuteronomy 4:35 (id: 1005004035)

35Yahweh showed all these things to you in order that you would know that only he is truly God and that there is no other God.


## Deuteronomy 4:36 (id: 1005004036)

36He allowed your parents to hear him speak from heaven in order that he could discipline them. Here on the earth, he allowed them to see his great fire {on Mount Sinai}. He spoke to them from the middle of the fire.


## Deuteronomy 4:37 (id: 1005004037)

37Because he loved our ancestors, he chose you Israelites, who are their descendants. By his great power, he brought us out of Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 4:38 (id: 1005004038)

38{As they traveled}, he expelled the people of nations that were greater and more powerful than we were. This is so that we could capture and live in their land, as we are about to do today.


## Deuteronomy 4:39 (id: 1005004039)

39So today you should think about the fact that Yahweh is God, that {he rules} in heaven and also on the earth, and that there is no other god.


## Deuteronomy 4:40 (id: 1005004040)

40Obey all the rules and regulations that I am giving to you today. This is so that things will go well for you and your descendants. And it is so that you will live a long time in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, so {it will belong to you} forever.”


## Deuteronomy 4:41 (id: 1005004041)

41Then Moses chose three cities that are on the east side of the Jordan River.


## Deuteronomy 4:42 (id: 1005004042)

## Deuteronomy 4:43 (id: 1005004043)

## Deuteronomy 4:44 (id: 1005004044)

44Moses gave God’s instructions to the Israelite people.

45They included all the instructions, rules, and regulations that Moses told the Israelite people after they had come out of Egypt,


## Deuteronomy 4:46 (id: 1005004046)

46when they were in the valley east of the Jordan River. They were across from the town of Beth Peor, in the land that {previously} was ruled by Sihon, the king of the Amor people group, who lived in the city of Heshbon. Moses and the other Israelites had defeated his army when they came out of Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 4:47 (id: 1005004047)

47They captured Sihon’s land and the land that Og, the king of the region of Bashan, had ruled. Those were the two kings who ruled the Amor people group in the area east of the Jordan River.


## Deuteronomy 4:48 (id: 1005004048)

48Their land extended from the city of Aroer in the south along the Arnon River, as far north as Mount Sirion, which {most people} call Mount Hermon.

2When we were at Mount Sinai, Yahweh our God made a covenant with us.

3But this covenant was not only for our ancestors; he made it also for us who are alive now.


## Deuteronomy 5:4 (id: 1005005004)

4Yahweh personally spoke with us on that mountain, from the middle of the fire.


## Deuteronomy 5:5 (id: 1005005005)

5On that day, I stood between Yahweh and your parents in order to tell them what he said. That was because they were afraid of the fire, and they did not want to climb up the mountain. This is what Yahweh said:


## Deuteronomy 5:6 (id: 1005005006)

6‘I am Yahweh your God, the one you worship. I am the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt. I am the one who freed you from being slaves there.


## Deuteronomy 5:7 (id: 1005005007)

## Deuteronomy 5:9 (id: 1005005009)

9Do not bow down to any idol or worship it, because I am Yahweh your God. I demand that you worship me only! I will punish the descendants of those who hate me. I will punish their descendants for three, even four {generations}.


## Deuteronomy 5:10 (id: 1005005010)

10However, I will faithfully love thousands of generations of those who love me and obey my commandments.


## Deuteronomy 5:11 (id: 1005005011)

11{I am} Yahweh your God, so do not use my name for the wrong purpose. This is because I will certainly punish those who use my name for wrong purposes.


## Deuteronomy 5:12 (id: 1005005012)

12Remember that the seventh day of every week belongs to me. This is according to what I, Yahweh your God, am commanding you.


## Deuteronomy 5:13 (id: 1005005013)

13There are six days each week for you to do all your labor.


## Deuteronomy 5:14 (id: 1005005014)

14But the seventh day is a day of rest, a day dedicated to me, Yahweh your God. On that day you must not do any work. Neither you nor your sons, your daughters, your male or female slaves, your livestock, and not even foreigners who are living in your country may work.


## Deuteronomy 5:15 (id: 1005005015)

15Remember that your families were slaves in Egypt. I, Yahweh your God, brought you out of there by my very great power. As a result, I am commanding that all of you must rest on the seventh day of each week.


## Deuteronomy 5:16 (id: 1005005016)

16Honor your father and your mother, just like I, Yahweh your God, am commanding you. Do this in order that you may live a long time in the land that I, Yahweh your God, will give you. Also do this in order that things will go well for you there.


## Deuteronomy 5:17 (id: 1005005017)

## Deuteronomy 5:22 (id: 1005005022)

22Those are the commandments that Yahweh commanded your families. They were gathered there at {the bottom of} the mountain. Yahweh spoke with a very loud voice from the middle of the fire, and there were dark clouds {around the mountain}. He spoke only those Ten Commandments. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.


## Deuteronomy 5:23 (id: 1005005023)

23Your parents heard Yahweh’s voice when he spoke to them out of the darkness, while there was a big fire burning on the mountain. After that, their leaders came to me.


## Deuteronomy 5:24 (id: 1005005024)

24{One of} them said, ‘Listen to us! Yahweh our God showed us that he is very glorious and great when we heard him speak from the fire. Today we have realized that it is possible for us human beings to continue to live even though God has spoken to us.


## Deuteronomy 5:25 (id: 1005005025)

25But we are afraid that we will die. We are afraid that this immense fire will burn us all up if we go on hearing Yahweh’s voice.


## Deuteronomy 5:26 (id: 1005005026)

26We are the only people on earth who have remained alive after hearing the all\-powerful God speak to them from a fire!


## Deuteronomy 5:27 (id: 1005005027)

27{So Moses}, you go {up the mountain} and listen to everything that Yahweh our God says. Then {come back} and tell us everything that he has said, and we will listen to what he has said and obey it.’


## Deuteronomy 5:28 (id: 1005005028)

28Yahweh heard your leaders say that. {When I went back up the mountain}, Yahweh said to me, ‘I have heard what your leaders have said. What they have said is right.


## Deuteronomy 5:29 (id: 1005005029)

29I surely wish that they would always have awesome respect for me and obey all my commandments. I desire their worship so that things may go well for them and for their descendants forever.


## Deuteronomy 5:30 (id: 1005005030)

30So go {down} and tell them to return to their tents.


## Deuteronomy 5:31 (id: 1005005031)

31But {then,} you {come back up} here and stand near me. I will give you all the rules and decrees that I {want them to obey}. Then you can teach them to the people so that they will obey them when they are in the land that I am giving to them.’


## Deuteronomy 5:32 (id: 1005005032)

32{So I went back down to the people and said to them}, ‘Be sure that you do everything that Yahweh our God has commanded us to do. Be sure to obey his commandments.


## Deuteronomy 5:33 (id: 1005005033)

33Conduct your lives as Yahweh our God has commanded us to do. This is so that you may live a long time. Also, this is so that things may go well for you {when you are living} in the land that you will occupy.’


## Deuteronomy 6:1 (id: 1005006001)

1These are the commandments, rules, and decrees that Yahweh our God commanded me to teach to you. He wants you to obey them in the land that you are about to enter and occupy.


## Deuteronomy 6:2 (id: 1005006002)

2He wants you to honor him. He wants you and your descendants to always obey all these rules and regulations that I am giving to you. This is so that you may live for a long time.


## Deuteronomy 6:3 (id: 1005006003)

3So, you Israelite people, listen to them carefully and obey them. If you do that, things will go well with you. Also, you will become a very numerous nation when you are {living} in that very fertile land. That is what Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped, promised would happen.


## Deuteronomy 6:4 (id: 1005006004)

4You Israelite people, listen! Only Yahweh is our God.


## Deuteronomy 6:5 (id: 1005006005)

5You must love him with all your inner being and with all that you feel and in every way that you can.


## Deuteronomy 6:6 (id: 1005006006)

6Remember these commands that I am giving to you today.


## Deuteronomy 6:7 (id: 1005006007)

7Teach them to your children again and again. Talk about them {at every opportunity,} such as when you are in your houses and when you are walking outside. Talk about them also when you are resting and when you are working.


## Deuteronomy 6:8 (id: 1005006008)

8{Write copies of them} and tie them to your arms and foreheads {to help you to remember them}.


## Deuteronomy 6:9 (id: 1005006009)

9Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your city gates.


## Deuteronomy 6:10 (id: 1005006010)

10Yahweh our God solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give you a land that already has in it large and prosperous cities that you did not build.


## Deuteronomy 6:11 (id: 1005006011)

11He said that the houses in those cities will already be full of many good things that someone else put there. There will be wells that someone else dug. There will be vineyards and olive trees that someone else planted. So when Yahweh brings you into that land, and you have all that you want to eat,


## Deuteronomy 6:12 (id: 1005006012)

12be sure to remember Yahweh, who rescued you from being slaves in Egypt {and gave all these things to you}.


## Deuteronomy 6:13 (id: 1005006013)

13You must deeply respect Yahweh our God, and you must worship him alone. When you make a solemn oath, say that he should punish you if you do not do what you have promised.


## Deuteronomy 6:14 (id: 1005006014)

14You must not worship any other gods, the gods that the people groups who live near you worship.


## Deuteronomy 6:15 (id: 1005006015)

15This is because Yahweh our God, who has a special relationship with you will not accept people who worship anyone or anything other than him. So if you worship any other god, Yahweh will be very angry with you, and he will destroy you completely.


## Deuteronomy 6:16 (id: 1005006016)

16Do not do sinful things to find out whether Yahweh will punish you or not, as your parents did at Massah.


## Deuteronomy 6:17 (id: 1005006017)

17Be sure that you always obey all the laws, the weighty instructions, and the regulations that he has given to you.


## Deuteronomy 6:18 (id: 1005006018)

18Do what Yahweh says is right and good. If you do that, things will go well with you. You will be able to enter and occupy the good land that Yahweh solemnly promised to give to our ancestors.


## Deuteronomy 6:19 (id: 1005006019)

19He will do that by driving out your enemies from that land, just as he promised to do.


## Deuteronomy 6:20 (id: 1005006020)

20In the future, your children will ask you, ‘Why did Yahweh our God command us to obey all these rules and decrees?’


## Deuteronomy 6:21 (id: 1005006021)

21Then you will tell them, ‘Our families were slaves of the king in Egypt. Yahweh brought them out of Egypt by his great power.


## Deuteronomy 6:22 (id: 1005006022)

22They saw him do many kinds of miracles and terrifying things to the people of Egypt and to the king and his officials.


## Deuteronomy 6:23 (id: 1005006023)

23He rescued our families from Egypt and brought them here to give them this land. This is just as he solemnly promised our ancestors that he would do.


## Deuteronomy 6:24 (id: 1005006024)

24And he commanded us to obey all these laws and to honor him. This is so that things will always go well with us and so that he will protect our nation, as he is doing now.


## Deuteronomy 6:25 (id: 1005006025)

25Yahweh our God will approve of us if we carefully obey everything that he has commanded us to do.’


## Deuteronomy 7:1 (id: 1005007001)

1Yahweh our God will take you into the land that you will soon enter and occupy. As you advance, he will expel these people groups that are more powerful and more numerous than you are. They are the Heth, the Girgash, the Amor, the Canaan, the Periz, the Hiv, and the Jebus people groups.


## Deuteronomy 7:2 (id: 1005007002)

2When Yahweh our God enables you to defeat them, you must kill them all. You must make no agreement with them, and you must not act mercifully toward them.


## Deuteronomy 7:3 (id: 1005007003)

3You must not marry any of them. You must not allow your daughters to marry any of their sons or allow your sons to marry any of their daughters.


## Deuteronomy 7:4 (id: 1005007004)

4If you did that, those people would persuade your children to stop worshiping Yahweh and to worship other gods. If that happens, Yahweh will be very angry with you, and he will destroy you very quickly.


## Deuteronomy 7:5 (id: 1005007005)

5This is what you must do to those people: Tear down their altars, break apart the stone pillars {that are dedicated to their gods}, cut down the poles {that they use when they worship the goddess Asherah}, and burn their molded idols.


## Deuteronomy 7:6 (id: 1005007006)

6You must do that because you are a group of people who belong only to Yahweh our God. He has chosen you from all the people groups in the world to be his own special people.


## Deuteronomy 7:7 (id: 1005007007)

7It was not because you were more numerous than any other people group that Yahweh chose you. In fact, you are one of the smallest people groups on the earth.


## Deuteronomy 7:8 (id: 1005007008)

8Instead, it is because Yahweh loved you and because he wanted to do what he solemnly promised to your ancestors. That is why he rescued you by his great power from slavery in Egypt and from Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 7:9 (id: 1005007009)

9So remember that Yahweh is our God. He is faithful to us. He will do what he agreed to do. He will faithfully love forever people who love him and who obey his commandments.


## Deuteronomy 7:10 (id: 1005007010)

10But as for those who hate him, he will pay them back. He will punish them and quickly destroy them.


## Deuteronomy 7:11 (id: 1005007011)

11So you must be sure to obey all the commandments, rules, and decrees that I am giving to you today.


## Deuteronomy 7:12 (id: 1005007012)

12If you pay attention to these decrees and always obey them, Yahweh our God will do what he has agreed to do for you. He will also faithfully love you, which is what he solemnly promised to your ancestors that he would do.


## Deuteronomy 7:13 (id: 1005007013)

13He will love you and bless you. He will enable you to have many children. He will bless your fields. As a result, you will have plenty of grain and {grapes to make} wine and plenty of olive oil. You will have many cattle and sheep. He will do all these things for you in the land that he promised to your ancestors that he would give to you.


## Deuteronomy 7:14 (id: 1005007014)

14He will bless you more than he will bless any other people group. All of you will be able to have children. All of your livestock will be able to produce offspring.


## Deuteronomy 7:15 (id: 1005007015)

15And Yahweh will protect you from all illnesses. He will not make you become sick with any of the dreadful diseases that {our ancestors} knew about in Egypt. But, he will make all your enemies sick with them.


## Deuteronomy 7:16 (id: 1005007016)

16You must destroy all the people groups that Yahweh our God enables you to conquer. Do not act mercifully toward any of them. And do not worship their gods. If you do that, it would be like falling into a trap {from which you will never be able to escape}.


## Deuteronomy 7:17 (id: 1005007017)

17Do not think to yourselves, ‘These people groups are more numerous than we are. We will never be able to drive them out.’


## Deuteronomy 7:18 (id: 1005007018)

18Do not be afraid of them. Instead, think about what Yahweh our God did to the king of Egypt and to all the people whom he {ruled}.


## Deuteronomy 7:19 (id: 1005007019)

19Remember the terrible plagues that your parents saw him inflict on the people of Egypt. Remember the various kinds of miracles that God did in order to bring your families out {of Egypt}. Yahweh our God will do the same kind of things to the people groups that you are afraid of now.


## Deuteronomy 7:20 (id: 1005007020)

20Furthermore, he will cause them to become terrified. He will destroy those who remain alive and run away to hide from you.


## Deuteronomy 7:21 (id: 1005007021)

21Do not be afraid of those people, because Yahweh our God will be with you. He is a great God. He is the one that people are afraid of.


## Deuteronomy 7:22 (id: 1005007022)

22He will gradually expel those people groups. You should not {try to} expel all of them at one time. If you did that, the number of wild animals would quickly increase, {and you would not be able to get rid of them}.


## Deuteronomy 7:23 (id: 1005007023)

23Instead, Yahweh will enable you to defeat your enemies {one people group at a time}. He will cause them to panic until they are destroyed.


## Deuteronomy 7:24 (id: 1005007024)

24He will enable you to defeat their kings. After you kill them, their names will be forgotten. No people group will be able to stop you. You will destroy all of them.


## Deuteronomy 7:25 (id: 1005007025)

25You must burn the carved figures {that represent} their gods. Do not desire to take the silver or gold {decorations} that are on those idols. If you take them for yourselves, they will be like a trap {to cause you to disobey God}. Yahweh hates every part of those idols.


## Deuteronomy 7:26 (id: 1005007026)

26You must not bring any of those disgusting idols into your houses, because if you do that, God will curse you as he curses them. You must hate and despise those idols, because they are things that Yahweh has cursed, and he promises to destroy them.


## Deuteronomy 8:1 (id: 1005008001)

1You must faithfully obey all the commandments that I am giving you today. If you do that, you will live a long time and you will become very numerous. Your people will occupy the land that Yahweh solemnly promised your ancestors {that he would give to you}.


## Deuteronomy 8:2 (id: 1005008002)

2And think about how Yahweh our God led us as we traveled through the desert during these past 40 years. He {caused you to have many problems}. This was to cause you to realize that you needed to trust him and not trust in yourselves. He also wanted to test you, to find out what you intended to do, whether you would obey his commandments or not.


## Deuteronomy 8:3 (id: 1005008003)

3So he caused you to have problems. He allowed you to become hungry. Then he gave you manna, {food from heaven}, food that you and your parents had never eaten before. He did that to teach you that people need food {for their bodies}, but {they also need food for their spirits. This comes from paying attention to} everything that Yahweh says.


## Deuteronomy 8:4 (id: 1005008004)

4During those 40 years, our clothes did not wear out. Also, our feet did not swell {from walking through the desert}.


## Deuteronomy 8:5 (id: 1005008005)

5Remember that Yahweh our God corrects us and punishes us, like parents correct their children.


## Deuteronomy 8:6 (id: 1005008006)

6So obey the commandments of Yahweh our God. Conduct your lives as he wants you to do and honor him.


## Deuteronomy 8:7 (id: 1005008007)

7He is about to bring you into a good land. It has streams that flow down from the hills and flow out of springs in the valleys.


## Deuteronomy 8:8 (id: 1005008008)

8It is a land on which wheat and barley grow. It has vineyards, fig trees, and pomegranates. It is a land where there are olive trees and honey.


## Deuteronomy 8:9 (id: 1005008009)

9It is a land where there will be plenty of food for you. You will have everything you need. It is a land which has iron {ore} in its rocks and from which you can dig copper {ore} from its hills.


## Deuteronomy 8:10 (id: 1005008010)

10{Every day} you will eat until your stomachs are full. You will thank Yahweh our God for the fertile land that he has given you.


## Deuteronomy 8:11 (id: 1005008011)

11But {when that happens}, be sure not to forget Yahweh our God by disobeying his commandments, rules, and regulations that I am giving to you today.


## Deuteronomy 8:12 (id: 1005008012)

12Do this even when your stomachs are full {every day}, and when you have built good houses and are living in them.


## Deuteronomy 8:13 (id: 1005008013)

13One day the number of your cattle and sheep will greatly increase. You will accumulate a large amount of silver and gold. The amount of all your other possessions will also greatly increase.


## Deuteronomy 8:14 (id: 1005008014)

14Even then, be sure that you do not become proud and forget Yahweh our God. He rescued your parents from being slaves in Egypt and brought them out from there.


## Deuteronomy 8:15 (id: 1005008015)

15Remember that he guided them while they traveled through that huge and terrible desert. There were poisonous snakes and scorpions there. And remember that the ground was very dry and there was no water. In spite of that, he caused water to flow for them out of solid rock.


## Deuteronomy 8:16 (id: 1005008016)

16Remember that in that desert he gave your families manna to eat. Manna was food that they had never eaten before. He did this so they would realize that they needed to trust him and not themselves. And he wanted to test them to find out if they would obey him. This is so that he could do many good things for them {when those difficulties ended}.


## Deuteronomy 8:17 (id: 1005008017)

17Be sure that you do not think to yourselves that you have acquired all these things by your own power and ability.


## Deuteronomy 8:18 (id: 1005008018)

18Remember that it is Yahweh our God who has enabled you to become rich. He does this because he faithfully does what he solemnly promised our ancestors that he would do.


## Deuteronomy 8:19 (id: 1005008019)

19Today I solemnly warn you: If you forget Yahweh our God and start to worship and serve other gods, then he will certainly destroy you.


## Deuteronomy 8:20 (id: 1005008020)

20If you do not obey Yahweh our God, then he will certainly destroy you just like he will destroy the people groups against which you will fight.


## Deuteronomy 9:1 (id: 1005009001)

1You people of Israel, listen to me! You will soon cross the Jordan River. In the land that you will enter, there are people groups that are more numerous and more powerful than you are. In that land, there are large cities that have very high walls {around them}. The walls are so high that they {seem to} extend up to the sky.


## Deuteronomy 9:2 (id: 1005009002)

2The people in the land are strong and tall. Some of them are descendants of Anak. You know about them, and you have heard people say that no one can defeat the descendants of Anak.


## Deuteronomy 9:3 (id: 1005009003)

3I want you to know that Yahweh our God will go ahead of you. He will be like a raging fire. While you advance, he will defeat and destroy them. As a result, you will quickly be able to drive out some of them and kill the others. This is just as Yahweh promised that you would do.


## Deuteronomy 9:4 (id: 1005009004)

4After Yahweh our God has expelled them for you, do not say to yourselves, ‘It is because we are righteous that Yahweh has enabled us to capture this land.’ Rather, it is because the people in that land are wicked that Yahweh will drive them out as you advance.


## Deuteronomy 9:5 (id: 1005009005)

5{Again}, it is not because you are righteous or do things that are righteous that you will inhabit that land. It is because those people groups are very wicked that Yahweh our God will expel them as you advance. It is also because he intends to do what he solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would do.


## Deuteronomy 9:6 (id: 1005009006)

6I want you to know that it is not because you are righteous that Yahweh our God is giving you this good land. I say this because you are a very stubborn people.


## Deuteronomy 9:7 (id: 1005009007)

7Never forget what your parents did in the desert that caused Yahweh our God to become angry. From the day that we left Egypt until the day that we arrived here, you have continually rebelled against him.


## Deuteronomy 9:8 (id: 1005009008)

8Even at Mount Sinai your parents caused Yahweh to become angry. Because he was very angry, he was ready to get rid of {all of} them.


## Deuteronomy 9:9 (id: 1005009009)

9I climbed the mountain to receive from him the stone tablets on which he had written the Ten Commandments. I stayed there 40 days and nights. During that time I did not eat or drink anything.


## Deuteronomy 9:10 (id: 1005009010)

10Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets on which he had written {the commandments} with his own fingers. They were the words that he had spoken to your parents from the fire on that mountain. This was when they were gathered together {at the bottom of the mountain}.


## Deuteronomy 9:11 (id: 1005009011)

11At the end of those 40 days and nights, Yahweh gave me those two stone tablets on which he had written those commandments.


## Deuteronomy 9:12 (id: 1005009012)

12But then he said to me, ‘Go down the mountain immediately! This is because {the people whom you are leading}, the people whom you led out of Egypt, have committed a terrible sin! They have very quickly done what I commanded them not to do. They have made for themselves a metal figure {of a calf to worship}.’


## Deuteronomy 9:13 (id: 1005009013)

13Then Yahweh said to me, ‘I have been watching these people. I see that they are very stubborn.


## Deuteronomy 9:14 (id: 1005009014)

14So do not try to stop me. I am going to destroy all of them, with the result that no one anywhere will remember their names. Then I will enable you to become {the ancestor} of a nation that will be more powerful and numerous than them.’


## Deuteronomy 9:15 (id: 1005009015)

15So I turned and went down the mountain. In my hands I carried the two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were {written}. Fire was burning all over the mountain.


## Deuteronomy 9:16 (id: 1005009016)

16I looked, and I was shocked to see that your parents had committed a great sin against Yahweh. They very quickly had begun to do what Yahweh our God had commanded them not to do. They had {requested Aaron} to make for them a metal figure of a calf {to worship}.


## Deuteronomy 9:17 (id: 1005009017)

17I lifted up those two stone tablets and threw them {on the ground}. They broke into pieces. I did this while they were watching.


## Deuteronomy 9:18 (id: 1005009018)

18Then I prostrated myself on the ground in Yahweh’s presence as I had done before. I did not eat or drink anything for 40 days and nights. I did that because your parents had sinned against Yahweh and caused him to become very angry.


## Deuteronomy 9:19 (id: 1005009019)

19I was afraid that because Yahweh was very angry with them, he would get rid of all of them. {But again I prayed that he would not do that}, and again he listened to me {and answered my prayer}.


## Deuteronomy 9:20 (id: 1005009020)

20Yahweh was also very angry with Aaron {for making that golden calf}. Yahweh was ready to kill him. But at the same time I prayed for Aaron also, {and Yahweh answered my prayer}.


## Deuteronomy 9:21 (id: 1005009021)

21Your parents had sinned {by requesting Aaron} to make {a metal figure of} a calf. So I took that figure and I melted it in a fire. Then, I crushed it and ground it into very tiny pieces. Then I threw those tiny pieces into the stream that flowed down the mountain.


## Deuteronomy 9:22 (id: 1005009022)

22Your parents also caused Yahweh to become very angry {by what they did at places that they named} Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth Hattaavah.


## Deuteronomy 9:23 (id: 1005009023)

23And when we were at Kadesh Barnea, Yahweh said to your parents, ‘Go and capture the land that I am about to give to you!’ But they rebelled against him. They did not trust him, and they did not obey what he told them to do.


## Deuteronomy 9:24 (id: 1005009024)

24Your parents rebelled against Yahweh from the first day that I knew them {in Egypt}.


## Deuteronomy 9:25 (id: 1005009025)

25So, as I said, I lay on the ground in Yahweh’s presence for 40 days and nights because Yahweh had said that he would get rid of your ancestors.


## Deuteronomy 9:26 (id: 1005009026)

26And I prayed to Yahweh, saying, ‘Lord Yahweh, these people belong to you. Do not destroy them. They are people whom you rescued and brought out of Egypt by your very great power.


## Deuteronomy 9:27 (id: 1005009027)

27Do not forget {what you promised} to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Ignore how stubborn and wicked these people have been, and the sin that they have committed.


## Deuteronomy 9:28 (id: 1005009028)

28If you destroy them, the people of Egypt will {hear about it}. They will say that you were not able to bring them into the land that you promised to give to them. They will say that you took them into the desert only to kill them there because you hated them.


## Deuteronomy 9:29 (id: 1005009029)

29{Remember} that they are your people. You chose them to belong to you. You brought them out {from Egypt} by your very great power.’


## Deuteronomy 10:1 (id: 1005010001)

1Then Yahweh said to me, ‘Cut two stone tablets like the first ones. And make a wooden chest to put them in. Then {bring the tablets} up to me on this mountain.


## Deuteronomy 10:2 (id: 1005010002)

2I will write on those tablets the same words that I wrote on the first tablets, the ones that you broke. Then you can put them in the chest.’


## Deuteronomy 10:3 (id: 1005010003)

3So I made a chest. I used wood from an acacia tree to make it. I cut two stone tablets like the first ones. Then I went up the mountain carrying the tablets.


## Deuteronomy 10:4 (id: 1005010004)

4There Yahweh wrote on the tablets the {same} Ten Commandments {that he had written on the first tablets}. They are the commandments that he had spoken to your parents from the midst of the fire on the mountain. This was when they had gathered {at the bottom of the mountain}. Then Yahweh gave the tablets to me.


## Deuteronomy 10:5 (id: 1005010005)

5{Carrying the tablets}, I went down the mountain. Then, just as he had commanded, I put them in the chest that I had made. And they are still there.”


## Deuteronomy 10:6 (id: 1005010006)

6(Then, from the wells that belonged to the people of Jaakan, the Israelite people traveled to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried. His son Eleazar took his place and became the great priest.


## Deuteronomy 10:7 (id: 1005010007)

7From there, the Israelites traveled to Gudgodah. From there, they traveled to Jotbathah, which was a place that had many streams.


## Deuteronomy 10:8 (id: 1005010008)

8At that time, Yahweh chose the tribe of Levi to carry the sacred chest {that had the stone tablets}, stand in Yahweh’s presence {in the sacred tent}, offer sacrifices, and pray for Yahweh to bless {the people}. They are still doing those things at the present time.


## Deuteronomy 10:9 (id: 1005010009)

9That is the reason that the tribe of Levi did not receive any land like the other tribes did. What they received was the honor of being Yahweh’s {priests}. This is according to what he said they should do.)


## Deuteronomy 10:10 (id: 1005010010)

10Moses continued to speak: “I stayed on the mountain 40 days and nights, just like I did the first time. {I prayed to} Yahweh, and he answered my prayers again. He said that he would not destroy your families.


## Deuteronomy 10:11 (id: 1005010011)

11Then Yahweh said to me, ‘Continue your journey and lead the people to occupy the land. This is the land that I solemnly promised your ancestors that I would give to you.’


## Deuteronomy 10:12 (id: 1005010012)

12Now, you Israelite people, I will tell you what Yahweh our God says that you do. He requires you to honor him, to conduct your lives as he wants you to, to love him, and to serve him with all that you desire and all that you feel,


## Deuteronomy 10:13 (id: 1005010013)

13and to obey all of his commandments which I am giving to you today. This is for your benefit.


## Deuteronomy 10:14 (id: 1005010014)

14Be aware that Yahweh our God owns even the sky and everything that is in it. He also owns the earth and everything that is on it.


## Deuteronomy 10:15 (id: 1005010015)

15But {although he owns all those things}, Yahweh also loved your ancestors. From all the people groups {on the earth} he chose us, their descendants, and we are still his people.


## Deuteronomy 10:16 (id: 1005010016)

16You must humble yourself and obey Yahweh’s covenant. Stop being stubborn!


## Deuteronomy 10:17 (id: 1005010017)

17Yahweh our God is greater than all gods, and he is greater than all rulers. He is very powerful. He is impartial, and he does not accept bribes.


## Deuteronomy 10:18 (id: 1005010018)

18He makes sure that orphans and widows are treated fairly. He loves even foreigners who live among us Israelite people. He gives them food and clothes.


## Deuteronomy 10:19 (id: 1005010019)

19So you must love those foreigners too. This is because you were once foreigners when you were living in Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 10:20 (id: 1005010020)

20You must deeply respect Yahweh our God, and you must worship him alone. Be faithful to him. When you make a solemn oath, say that he should punish you if you do not do what you have promised.


## Deuteronomy 10:21 (id: 1005010021)

21He is the one whom you must praise. He is our God. We have seen the great and awesome things that he has done for us.


## Deuteronomy 10:22 (id: 1005010022)

22When our ancestors, {Jacob and his family}, went down to Egypt, there were only 70 of them. But now Yahweh our God has caused us to be as numerous as the stars in the sky.


## Deuteronomy 11:1 (id: 1005011001)

1{Because of all that} Yahweh your God {has done for you}, you must love him. Also, you must continually obey all his rules, decrees, and commandments.


## Deuteronomy 11:2 (id: 1005011002)

2It was you and your parents, not your children, whom he personally instructed. So starting today, think about how you saw his greatness and amazing power.


## Deuteronomy 11:3 (id: 1005011003)

3Remember the many different miracles that he performed in Egypt. Think about what he did to the king of Egypt and everything there.


## Deuteronomy 11:4 (id: 1005011004)

4Your children did not see Yahweh destroy the army of Egypt, their horses, or their chariots. Your children did not see how Yahweh caused the Sea of Reeds to flood and drown the army of Egypt as they were coming after their ancestors. Yahweh continues to make Egypt’s army weak even to this day.


## Deuteronomy 11:5 (id: 1005011005)

5Your children did not see how Yahweh took care of their families in the desert before they all came to this place.


## Deuteronomy 11:6 (id: 1005011006)

6Your children did not see what Yahweh did to the rebels, Dathan and Abiram, the two sons of Eliab from the tribe of Reuben. While all of your families were watching, the earth split open, and they fell into the opening and disappeared. Their families, their tents, their servants, and their animals also disappeared with them.


## Deuteronomy 11:7 (id: 1005011007)

7You and your parents have seen all these miracles that Yahweh performed.


## Deuteronomy 11:8 (id: 1005011008)

8So obey all the commandments that I am giving you today. This is so that you will be strong and able to enter and occupy the land after crossing the river.


## Deuteronomy 11:9 (id: 1005011009)

9This is also so that you will live for a long time in that land. That land is the land that Yahweh solemnly promised your ancestors that he would give to them and to their descendants. The land is very fertile.


## Deuteronomy 11:10 (id: 1005011010)

10It is not like the land of Egypt, where your ancestors lived. In Egypt, they struggled to plant seeds and water the plants.


## Deuteronomy 11:11 (id: 1005011011)

11But the land that you are about to enter is a land where there are many hills and valleys. In that land there is plenty of rain.


## Deuteronomy 11:12 (id: 1005011012)

12Yahweh takes care of that land. He watches over it every day, from the beginning of each year to the end of each year.


## Deuteronomy 11:13 (id: 1005011013)

13Today I am commanding you to love Yahweh our God and to serve him with your entire inner being. If you do that,


## Deuteronomy 11:14 (id: 1005011014)

14each year he will send rain on your land at the right times. As a result, you will have grain and grapes to make wine and olives to make olive oil.


## Deuteronomy 11:15 (id: 1005011015)

15And he will cause grass to grow in your fields for your livestock to eat. You will have all the food that you want.


## Deuteronomy 11:16 (id: 1005011016)

16I warn you to be careful. Otherwise, you might be tempted to stop worshiping Yahweh. And, you might start to worship other gods.


## Deuteronomy 11:17 (id: 1005011017)

17If that happens, Yahweh will become very angry with you. He will prevent any rain from falling. As a result, the crops will not grow. You will soon die {from hunger} in the good land that Yahweh is about to give to you.


## Deuteronomy 11:18 (id: 1005011018)

18So, keep thinking about what Yahweh has commanded you. {Write copies of them} and tie them to your arms and foreheads {to help you to remember them}.


## Deuteronomy 11:19 (id: 1005011019)

19Teach them to your children again and again. Talk about them {at every opportunity,} such as when you are in your houses and when you are walking outside. Talk about them also when you are resting and when you are working.


## Deuteronomy 11:20 (id: 1005011020)

20Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your city gates.


## Deuteronomy 11:21 (id: 1005011021)

21Do this so that you and your descendants will live for a very long time in the land. It is the land that Yahweh promised to our ancestors that he would give to them. That land will belong to you and your descendants forever.


## Deuteronomy 11:22 (id: 1005011022)

22Faithfully obey what I am commanding you to do. Love Yahweh our God, conduct your lives as he wants you to, and be faithful to him. If you do this,


## Deuteronomy 11:23 (id: 1005011023)

23then Yahweh will drive out all the people groups {in that land} as you advance. These are people groups that are more numerous and more powerful than you are.


## Deuteronomy 11:24 (id: 1005011024)

24Everywhere you go, the land will be yours. Your territory will extend from the desert in the south to the Lebanon Mountains in the north. It will extend from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.


## Deuteronomy 11:25 (id: 1005011025)

25Yahweh our God will cause all the people in that land to be very afraid of you. No people group will be able to stop you. It will be just as he promised.


## Deuteronomy 11:26 (id: 1005011026)

26Be aware that today I am telling you that Yahweh will either bless you or he will curse you.


## Deuteronomy 11:27 (id: 1005011027)

27If you obey the commandments of Yahweh our God that I am giving to you today, he will bless you.


## Deuteronomy 11:28 (id: 1005011028)

28But if you do not obey them, stop worshiping him and start worshiping other gods to whom you were never faithful before, he will curse you.


## Deuteronomy 11:29 (id: 1005011029)

29And when Yahweh brings you into the land that you are about to enter and occupy, this is what you must do. {Some of} you {must stand} on top of Mount Gerizim and proclaim what will cause Yahweh to bless you. {The others must stand} on top of Mount Ebal and proclaim what will cause Yahweh to curse you.”


## Deuteronomy 11:30 (id: 1005011030)

30(Those two mountains are west of the Jordan River, west of the plain along the Jordan River, in the land where the Canaanites live. They live close to the sacred trees near Gilgal.)


## Deuteronomy 11:31 (id: 1005011031)

31“You will soon cross the Jordan River to occupy the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you. When you start to live in that land,


## Deuteronomy 11:32 (id: 1005011032)

32be sure to obey all the rules and decrees that I am giving to you today.


## Deuteronomy 12:1 (id: 1005012001)

1I will now tell you the rules and decrees that you must faithfully obey in the land. Yahweh, the God whom our ancestors worshiped, is giving to you the land to occupy. You must obey these laws all the time that you are alive.


## Deuteronomy 12:2 (id: 1005012002)

2When you drive out those people groups, you must destroy all the places where they worshiped their gods. These places include places on the tops of mountains and hills and beside large trees.


## Deuteronomy 12:3 (id: 1005012003)

3Tear down their altars, demolish the stone pillars {that are dedicated to their gods}, burn the poles {that they use when they worship the goddess Asherah}, and chop down their carved idols. This is so that no one will ever worship them in those places again.


## Deuteronomy 12:4 (id: 1005012004)

4Do not worship Yahweh like {the people in Canaan worship their gods}.


## Deuteronomy 12:5 (id: 1005012005)

5Instead, you must go to the place that Yahweh will choose. It will be in the area where one of your tribes will live. That is where you must enter Yahweh’s presence and worship him.


## Deuteronomy 12:6 (id: 1005012006)

6That is the place where you must bring all of your offerings. These include the wholly burned sacrifice, other sacrifices, one tenth of all your produce and animals, special contributions, sacrifices for promises, unprompted sacrifices, and the firstborn animals from your cattle and sheep.


## Deuteronomy 12:7 (id: 1005012007)

7There, in the presence of Yahweh our God, you and your families will eat the good things that you have worked to produce, and you will be happy, because he has blessed you {very much}.


## Deuteronomy 12:8 (id: 1005012008)

8{When you are in that land,} you must not do some of the things that we have been doing. Until now, you have all been worshiping Yahweh the way you want to.


## Deuteronomy 12:9 (id: 1005012009)

9This is because you have not yet arrived in the land that he will allow you to permanently possess. There, you will be able to live peacefully.


## Deuteronomy 12:10 (id: 1005012010)

10After you cross the Jordan River, you will start to live in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you. He will protect you from all your enemies that will surround you. You will live peacefully.


## Deuteronomy 12:11 (id: 1005012011)

11Yahweh will choose one place where he wants you to worship him. That is the place to which you must bring all the offerings that I command you to bring. These include the wholly burned sacrifice, other sacrifices, one tenth of all your produce and animals, special contributions, and sacrifices for promises you make to Yahweh.


## Deuteronomy 12:12 (id: 1005012012)

12Celebrate there in the presence of Yahweh, with your children, your servants, and the Levites who live in your towns. Remember that the Levites will not have their own land, like you do.


## Deuteronomy 12:13 (id: 1005012013)

13Do not offer your wholly burnt sacrifice anywhere else.


## Deuteronomy 12:14 (id: 1005012014)

14Only offer them in the place that Yahweh will choose. The place will be in an area that belongs to one of your tribes. That is the only place where you may offer the wholly burnt sacrifice and do the other things that I am commanding you to do {when you worship him}.


## Deuteronomy 12:15 (id: 1005012015)

15However, you may kill and eat your animals wherever you live as much as you want. These animals are blessings from Yahweh your God. Impure and pure people may eat that meat, just like you would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope.


## Deuteronomy 12:16 (id: 1005012016)

16But do not eat the blood {of any animal}. Let the blood drain onto the ground {before you cook the meat}.


## Deuteronomy 12:17 (id: 1005012017)

17Do not eat any offering for Yahweh where you live. Do not eat the one tenth of your produce and animals that are set aside for Yahweh. Do not eat any of the offerings for promises, unprompted offerings, or special contributions.


## Deuteronomy 12:18 (id: 1005012018)

18Instead, you must eat those offerings in the presence of Yahweh in the place that he chooses. You must do this along with your children, your servants, and the Levites who live in your towns. Enjoy the results of your hard work.


## Deuteronomy 12:19 (id: 1005012019)

19Be sure that you take care of the Levites who live among you.


## Deuteronomy 12:20 (id: 1005012020)

20In the future, Yahweh will give you more territory, as he has promised. At that time, if you want to eat meat in that new territory, you may eat as much as you want.


## Deuteronomy 12:21 (id: 1005012021)

21If the place that Yahweh our God chooses for you to worship him is far from {where you live}, I will tell you what to do. You may kill and eat some of your animals where you live, as much as you want.


## Deuteronomy 12:22 (id: 1005012022)

22Impure and pure people may eat that meat, just like you would eat the meat of a deer or an antelope.


## Deuteronomy 12:23 (id: 1005012023)

23But be sure that you do not eat the blood of any animal. This is because blood keeps humans and animals alive. You must not eat that which sustains life along with the meat.


## Deuteronomy 12:24 (id: 1005012024)

24Do not eat the blood. Instead, let it drain onto the ground.


## Deuteronomy 12:25 (id: 1005012025)

25If you obey this command and do what Yahweh says is right for you to do, you and your descendants will prosper.


## Deuteronomy 12:26 (id: 1005012026)

26But this is what you must do with your offerings and anything that you promise to give to Yahweh. You must take those things to the place that he will choose.


## Deuteronomy 12:27 (id: 1005012027)

27There you will offer the animals for the wholly burned sacrifice on the altar. {You will also offer the fellowship sacrifice there. After you kill the animals, the priest} will take the blood from the animals and splatter it onto every side of the altar. {Then, the priests will receive their portion of the meat.} You may eat {the rest of} the meat.


## Deuteronomy 12:28 (id: 1005012028)

28Faithfully obey all these commands. If you do that, you and your descendants will prosper forever. This is because you will be doing what Yahweh our God says is right for you to do.


## Deuteronomy 12:29 (id: 1005012029)

29When you enter the land that you will occupy, Yahweh our God will destroy the people groups that live there as you advance.


## Deuteronomy 12:30 (id: 1005012030)

30After he does that, be sure that you do not worship the gods of those people groups. If you do, it will be like a trap that will catch you. Do not ask them how they worshiped their gods just so you can worship Yahweh in the same way.


## Deuteronomy 12:31 (id: 1005012031)

31Do not try to worship Yahweh our God like they have worshiped their gods. This is because they do disgusting things when they worship them. Yahweh hates those disgusting things. The worst thing that they do is that they burn their own children on altars for their gods.


## Deuteronomy 12:32 (id: 1005012032)

32Be sure to obey all these commands. Do not add anything to these commands, and do not take anything away from them.


## Deuteronomy 13:1 (id: 1005013001)

1In the future, there could be people in your community who say that they are prophets. They may say that they are able to interpret the meaning of dreams or perform various kinds of miracles.


## Deuteronomy 13:2 (id: 1005013002)

2They will say those things to convince you to worship gods that you have never known about before. But even if what they predict happens,


## Deuteronomy 13:3 (id: 1005013003)

3do not pay attention to what they say. This is because Yahweh our God will observe how you behave to find out if you love him with all your inner being.


## Deuteronomy 13:4 (id: 1005013004)

4You must conduct your lives as Yahweh our God wants you to. You must honor him, do what he tells you to do, and be faithful to him.


## Deuteronomy 13:5 (id: 1005013005)

5But you must execute anyone who tells you to disobey Yahweh our God. This includes anyone who says he is a prophet, or anyone who says that he can interpret dreams. This is because Yahweh himself rescued your families from being slaves in Egypt. Those people want to convince you to disobey what Yahweh has told you to do. Execute them to get rid of those kinds of evil acts in your community.


## Deuteronomy 13:6 (id: 1005013006)

6Your brother, son, daughter, wife, or some close friend might privately urge you to disobey. They might urge you to worship other gods that you and your ancestors never knew about before.


## Deuteronomy 13:7 (id: 1005013007)

7They might urge you to worship gods that nearby or faraway people groups worship.


## Deuteronomy 13:8 (id: 1005013008)

8Do not do what they suggest. Do not even listen to them. Do not act mercifully toward them, and do not keep secret what they have done.


## Deuteronomy 13:9 (id: 1005013009)

9Execute them! Be the first one to {throw stones} at them to kill them. Then, everyone else must {throw stones at them}, too.


## Deuteronomy 13:10 (id: 1005013010)

10Kill such people by throwing stones at them. This is because they tell you to disobey Yahweh our God, who rescued your ancestors from being slaves in Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 13:11 (id: 1005013011)

11When they are executed, all the Israelite people will hear what happened. They will become afraid, and none of them will do such an evil thing again.


## Deuteronomy 13:12 (id: 1005013012)

12When you are living in one of the towns in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, you may hear


## Deuteronomy 13:13 (id: 1005013013)

13that some worthless people among you are deceiving the people of their town. They might urge you to worship other gods.


## Deuteronomy 13:14 (id: 1005013014)

14Examine the facts about it thoroughly. Suppose you find out that it is true that such a disgraceful thing has happened.


## Deuteronomy 13:15 (id: 1005013015)

15Then kill all the people in that town. And kill all their livestock, too. Destroy the town completely.


## Deuteronomy 13:16 (id: 1005013016)

16Gather all the possessions that belonged to the people who lived there and pile them up in the city plaza. Then burn the town and everything in it. It will be like an offering to Yahweh that was completely burned on the altar. The ruins must stay there forever. The town must never be rebuilt.


## Deuteronomy 13:17 (id: 1005013017)

17You must not take for yourselves anything that Yahweh has said must be destroyed. If you do what I say, Yahweh will stop being angry with you, and he will act mercifully toward you. And he will cause you to have many children, which is what he promised our ancestors that he would do.


## Deuteronomy 13:18 (id: 1005013018)

18Yahweh our God will do all those things if you do what he is telling you to do, obey all the commandments that I am giving to you today, and do what Yahweh says is right for you to do.


## Deuteronomy 14:1 (id: 1005014001)

1We are people who belong to Yahweh our God. So when people die, do not show that you are grieving {like the other people groups do}. Do not gash yourselves or shave the hair on your foreheads when you grieve.


## Deuteronomy 14:2 (id: 1005014002)

2We belong to Yahweh alone. Yahweh chose us from all the other people groups on the earth to be his special people.


## Deuteronomy 14:3 (id: 1005014003)

3Do not eat anything that Yahweh detests.


## Deuteronomy 14:4 (id: 1005014004)

4The animals whose meat you are permitted to eat are cattle, sheep, goats,


## Deuteronomy 14:5 (id: 1005014005)

5all kinds of deer, gazelles, wild goats, and mountain sheep.


## Deuteronomy 14:6 (id: 1005014006)

6Those are animals that have split hooves and that also chew the cud.


## Deuteronomy 14:7 (id: 1005014007)

7But there are other animals that chew the cud that you must not eat. Those are camels, rabbits, and rock badgers. They chew the cud, but their hooves are not split. So they are not acceptable for you to eat.


## Deuteronomy 14:8 (id: 1005014008)

8Do not eat pigs. They are unacceptable for you to eat. Their hooves are split, but they do not {chew} the cud. Do not eat the meat of those animals; do not even touch their dead bodies.


## Deuteronomy 14:9 (id: 1005014009)

9You are permitted to eat any fish that has fins and scales.


## Deuteronomy 14:10 (id: 1005014010)

10But anything else that lives in the water that does not have fins and scales you must not eat. They are unacceptable for you to eat.


## Deuteronomy 14:11 (id: 1005014011)

11You are permitted to eat the flesh of any bird that is acceptable to Yahweh.


## Deuteronomy 14:12 (id: 1005014012)

12But you may not eat large birds that eat dead animals,


## Deuteronomy 14:13 (id: 1005014013)

13large birds that hunt animals, or any kind of bird that hunts animals.


## Deuteronomy 14:14 (id: 1005014014)

14You are not permitted to eat any kind of raven,


## Deuteronomy 14:15 (id: 1005014015)

15any birds that live in ruins,


## Deuteronomy 14:16 (id: 1005014016)

16birds that hunt animals at night, small water\-birds that eat fish,


## Deuteronomy 14:17 (id: 1005014017)

17or any other birds that live in ruins.


## Deuteronomy 14:18 (id: 1005014018)

18You are not permitted to eat large water\-birds, crested birds, or bats.


## Deuteronomy 14:19 (id: 1005014019)

19You must not eat any insect with wings and which swarm. They are unacceptable to Yahweh for you to eat.


## Deuteronomy 14:20 (id: 1005014020)

20But other insects with wings are acceptable to eat.


## Deuteronomy 14:21 (id: 1005014021)

21Do not eat any animal that has died naturally. You may allow foreigners who live among you to eat those things. You may also sell them to other foreigners. But you are a people group that belongs to Yahweh our God. {Those who belong to him are not permitted to eat the flesh of animals whose blood has not been drained out.} You must not cook a young sheep or goat in its mother’s milk.


## Deuteronomy 14:22 (id: 1005014022)

22Once each year you must set apart a tenth of all the crops that are produced in your fields.


## Deuteronomy 14:23 (id: 1005014023)

23Take them to the place that Yahweh our God will choose for you to worship him. There you must eat the tenth of your grain, your wine, your olive oil, and the meat of the firstborn male animals of your cattle and your sheep. Do this in order that you may learn to always honor Yahweh. {He has blessed you by giving you these things.}


## Deuteronomy 14:24 (id: 1005014024)

24It could be that the place that Yahweh has chosen for you to worship him is very far from your home. As a result, you might not be able to take the tenth of your crops which are a blessing from Yahweh.


## Deuteronomy 14:25 (id: 1005014025)

25In that case, you must sell the tenth of your crops. Then, wrap the money carefully in a cloth and take it with you to the place of worship that Yahweh has chosen.


## Deuteronomy 14:26 (id: 1005014026)

26There, with that money, you may buy whatever you want to. It could be beef, lamb, wine, or fermented drinks. And there, in the presence of Yahweh, you and your families should eat and drink those things and be happy.


## Deuteronomy 14:27 (id: 1005014027)

27But be sure to not neglect to help the descendants of Levi who live in your towns, because they will not own any land.


## Deuteronomy 14:28 (id: 1005014028)

28At the end of every three years, bring a tenth of all your crops that have been produced in that year and store it in your towns.


## Deuteronomy 14:29 (id: 1005014029)

29That food will be for the descendants of Levi, because they will not have their own land. That food will also be for the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. They are permitted to come {to where the food is stored} and take what they need. Do that in order that Yahweh our God will bless you in everything that you do.


## Deuteronomy 15:1 (id: 1005015001)

1At the end of {every} seven years, you must cancel all debts.


## Deuteronomy 15:2 (id: 1005015002)

2Do it like this: Each of you who has lent money to a fellow Israelite must cancel that debt. You must not insist that he pay it back. You must do that because Yahweh has declared that the debts must be canceled every seven years.


## Deuteronomy 15:3 (id: 1005015003)

3During that year you may require foreigners who live among you to pay what they owe you, but you must not demand that from any fellow Israelite.


## Deuteronomy 15:4 (id: 1005015004)

4(4\-5\) Yahweh our God will bless you in the land that he is giving to you. If you obey Yahweh our God and obey all the commandments that I am giving to you today, there will not be any poor people among you.


## Deuteronomy 15:6 (id: 1005015006)

6Yahweh our God will bless you like he has promised to do. You will be able to lend money to people of other people groups, but you will not need a loan from any of them. You will influence {the finances of} many people groups, but they will not influence yours.


## Deuteronomy 15:7 (id: 1005015007)

7In the towns that Yahweh our God is giving to you, if there are any Israelites who are poor, do not be selfish and refuse to help them.


## Deuteronomy 15:8 (id: 1005015008)

8Instead, be generous and lend them the money that they need.


## Deuteronomy 15:9 (id: 1005015009)

9When the year when debts will be canceled is near, do not think to yourself that {you should not lend anyone money because} they will not need to pay it back. It would be evil to withhold help from a needy fellow Israelite. If you do that, he could pray to Yahweh against you. Then {Yahweh will say that} you have sinned by not helping that person.


## Deuteronomy 15:10 (id: 1005015010)

10Give freely to poor people and give generously. If you do that, Yahweh will bless you in everything that you do.


## Deuteronomy 15:11 (id: 1005015011)

11There will always be some poor people in your land, so I command you to give generously to poor people, to your fellow Israelites.


## Deuteronomy 15:12 (id: 1005015012)

12If any of your fellow Israelite men or women sell themselves to one of you {to become your slave}, you must free them after they have worked for you for six years. When the seventh year comes, you must free them.


## Deuteronomy 15:13 (id: 1005015013)

13When you free them, do not allow them to go empty\-handed.


## Deuteronomy 15:14 (id: 1005015014)

14Instead, give to them generously from the things with which Yahweh has blessed you—sheep, grain, and wine.


## Deuteronomy 15:15 (id: 1005015015)

15Do not forget that your ancestors were once slaves in Egypt and that Yahweh our God freed them. So, I am now commanding you to do this.


## Deuteronomy 15:16 (id: 1005015016)

16It may happen that one of your slaves tells you they do not want to leave you. Perhaps he loves you and your household because you have treated him well.


## Deuteronomy 15:17 (id: 1005015017)

17In that case, take him to the door of your house. While he is standing against the doorway, pierce one of his earlobes with an awl. That will indicate that he will be your slave for the rest of his life. Do the same thing to any female slave {who does not want to leave you}.


## Deuteronomy 15:18 (id: 1005015018)

18Do not complain when you are required to free your slaves. Keep in mind that they served you for six years, and that you paid them only half as much as you pay the servants that you hire. If you free them, Yahweh our God will bless you in everything that you do.


## Deuteronomy 15:19 (id: 1005015019)

19Set aside for the honor of Yahweh our God the firstborn male animals from your cattle and sheep. Do not force them to do any work for you, and do not shear the wool of the firstborn animals.


## Deuteronomy 15:20 (id: 1005015020)

20Each year, you and your family must kill them and eat their meat in the presence of Yahweh at the place that he chooses for you to worship him.


## Deuteronomy 15:21 (id: 1005015021)

21But if the animals have any defects, if they are lame or blind, or if they have any other serious defect, you must not sacrifice them to Yahweh our God.


## Deuteronomy 15:22 (id: 1005015022)

22You may kill and eat the meat of those animals in your towns. The impure and pure people {may eat it}, just like {anyone is permitted to eat} the meat of a gazelle or a deer.


## Deuteronomy 15:23 (id: 1005015023)

23But you must not eat any of the blood. You must drain all the blood on the ground when you kill those animals.


## Deuteronomy 16:1 (id: 1005016001)

1{Each year} honor Yahweh our God in the early spring with the Passover Celebration. It was on a night in the early spring that Yahweh rescued your families from Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 16:2 (id: 1005016002)

2In order to celebrate, go to the place that Yahweh will choose for you to worship him. There, sacrifice one young animal from your sheep or cattle.


## Deuteronomy 16:3 (id: 1005016003)

3When you eat the Passover meal, the bread that you eat must not have yeast in it. You must eat this kind of bread, which will be called the bread of suffering, for seven days. This is to help you to always remember {that your families were suffering in Egypt because they were slaves.} When they left Egypt, they left very quickly. {They did not have time to put in yeast and wait for the dough to rise.}


## Deuteronomy 16:4 (id: 1005016004)

4During the Passover Celebration, which will last for seven days, you must not have any yeast {in any house} in your land. Furthermore, the meat of the animal that you sacrifice on the evening of the first day of the Passover Festival must be eaten during that night. Do not allow any of it to remain until the next day.


## Deuteronomy 16:5 (id: 1005016005)

5(5\-6\) You must offer the Passover sacrifice only at the place that he chooses for you to worship him. Do not offer that sacrifice in any other town in the land that Yahweh is giving to you. Offer that sacrifice when the sun is setting, at the same time of day that your ancestors started to leave Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 16:7 (id: 1005016007)

7Boil the meat and eat it at the place of worship that Yahweh our God chooses. The next morning, you may return to your tents.


## Deuteronomy 16:8 (id: 1005016008)

8Each day for six days the bread that you eat must have no yeast in it. On the seventh day, you must all gather to worship Yahweh our God. You must not do any work on that day.


## Deuteronomy 16:9 (id: 1005016009)

9Each year, from the day that you start to harvest your grain, count seven weeks.


## Deuteronomy 16:10 (id: 1005016010)

10Then, to honor Yahweh our God, celebrate the Celebration of Weeks. Do that by bringing to him an offering of grain. Yahweh has blessed you by causing it to grow in your fields during that year. If you had a big harvest, bring a big offering. If you had a small harvest, bring a small offering.


## Deuteronomy 16:11 (id: 1005016011)

11Each married couple should be joyful in the presence of Yahweh. Their children, their servants, the descendants of Levi who are in that town, and the foreigners, orphans, and widows who are living among you, should also be joyful. Bring those offerings to the place of worship that Yahweh will choose.


## Deuteronomy 16:12 (id: 1005016012)

12When you celebrate these festivals by obeying these commands, remember that your families were slaves in Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 16:13 (id: 1005016013)

13Each year, after you have threshed all your grain and pressed the juice from all your grapes, you must celebrate the Festival of Shelters for seven days.


## Deuteronomy 16:14 (id: 1005016014)

14Each married couple along with their children, their servants, the descendants of Levi who are in that town, and the foreigners, orphans, and widows who are living among you, should be joyful in the presence of Yahweh.


## Deuteronomy 16:15 (id: 1005016015)

15Honor Yahweh our God by celebrating this festival for seven days in the place that he chooses for you to worship him. You should all be joyful, because Yahweh will have blessed your harvest and all the other work that you have done.


## Deuteronomy 16:16 (id: 1005016016)

16So, each year all of you Israelite men must gather to worship Yahweh our God at the place that he will choose, to celebrate three festivals: The Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Celebration of Weeks, and the Festival of Shelters. No one should come before Yahweh without an offering.


## Deuteronomy 16:17 (id: 1005016017)

17The offerings should be in proportion to the blessings that Yahweh has given you during that year.


## Deuteronomy 16:18 (id: 1005016018)

18Appoint judges and other officials throughout your tribes, in all the towns in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you. They must judge people fairly.


## Deuteronomy 16:19 (id: 1005016019)

19They must not judge unjustly. They must not favor one person more than another. The judges must not accept bribes. If a judge accepts a bribe, even if he is wise and honest, it will be very difficult for him to judge fairly. He will do what the person who gave him the bribe wants him to do.


## Deuteronomy 16:20 (id: 1005016020)

20You must be completely fair and just, in order that you may live long enough to occupy the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.


## Deuteronomy 16:21 (id: 1005016021)

21When you make an altar to worship Yahweh our God, do not put next to it any wooden pole that represents the goddess Asherah.


## Deuteronomy 16:22 (id: 1005016022)

22And do not set up any stone pillar to worship any idol, because Yahweh hates them.


## Deuteronomy 17:1 (id: 1005017001)

1Do not sacrifice to Yahweh our God any cattle, sheep, or goat that has any defect. This is because Yahweh detests that kind of gift.


## Deuteronomy 17:2 (id: 1005017002)

2When you are living in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, suppose that some man or woman in one of your towns sins by disobeying the agreement that Yahweh has made with you.


## Deuteronomy 17:3 (id: 1005017003)

3Suppose that the person has worshiped other gods, the sun, the moon, or the stars. Remember that I commanded you not to do this.


## Deuteronomy 17:4 (id: 1005017004)

4Suppose that someone tells you of this idol worship, and you confirm that this detestable thing has happened in Israel.


## Deuteronomy 17:5 (id: 1005017005)

5In that case, you must take the man or woman who has sinned outside of your town. Then you must kill that person by throwing stones at him or her.


## Deuteronomy 17:6 (id: 1005017006)

6At least two people must confirm that they saw the person sin before you execute that person. If only one person says they saw the sin happen, you must not kill the person who is accused.


## Deuteronomy 17:7 (id: 1005017007)

7The people who saw the sin happen should throw stones at the guilty person. Then all the other people from that town should throw stones until the guilty person dies. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice from your community.


## Deuteronomy 17:8 (id: 1005017008)

8Sometimes it will be very difficult for a judge to decide what really happened. It could be that he must decide whether someone killed another on purpose or accidentally. Or, it could be that he must decide if one person or another has the legal right in a case. Or, it could be that he must decide whether someone hurt another, or the property of another. If in any town it is very difficult to know what really happened, and the judge cannot decide it, you should go to the place where Yahweh our God will choose for you to worship him.


## Deuteronomy 17:9 (id: 1005017009)

9There, you should explain the case to the descendants of Levi who are priests, and to the judge who is serving at that time. They should decide what should be done.


## Deuteronomy 17:10 (id: 1005017010)

10After they make their decision, you must do what they tell you to do.


## Deuteronomy 17:11 (id: 1005017011)

11Accept what they have decided, and do what they say that you should do. Do not try to change in any way what they have decided.


## Deuteronomy 17:12 (id: 1005017012)

12You must execute anyone who proudly disobeys the judge or the priest who stands there in the presence of Yahweh and decides what should be done. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice from all the Israelites.


## Deuteronomy 17:13 (id: 1005017013)

13Then after that person is executed, all the people will hear about it, and they will be afraid. None of them will proudly disobey anymore.


## Deuteronomy 17:14 (id: 1005017014)

14After you occupy and live in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, you might want a king to rule over you, as the nearby peoples do.


## Deuteronomy 17:15 (id: 1005017015)

15{Yahweh our God will permit you to have a king.} But, be sure that you appoint someone whom he has chosen. Your king must be an Israelite. A foreigner cannot be your king.


## Deuteronomy 17:16 (id: 1005017016)

16After he becomes the king, he should not own a large number of horses. He should not send people to Egypt to buy horses for him. Remember that Yahweh told you that you would never return to Egypt again.


## Deuteronomy 17:17 (id: 1005017017)

17And he must not marry a lot of wives. If he did that, they might cause him to stop worshipping Yahweh. And he must not obtain a lot of silver and gold.


## Deuteronomy 17:18 (id: 1005017018)

18When he becomes your king, he must {appoint a scribe to} copy these laws. The scribe must copy them from the scroll that is kept by the priests descended from Levi.


## Deuteronomy 17:19 (id: 1005017019)

19He must keep this new scroll near him and read from it every day of his life This is so that he may learn to have an awesome respect for Yahweh. Also, this is so that he may faithfully obey all the rules and regulations that are written in these laws.


## Deuteronomy 17:20 (id: 1005017020)

20If he does that, he will not think that he is more important than his fellow Israelites. And, he will completely obey Yahweh’s commands. As a result, he and his descendants will rule as kings in Israel for many years.


## Deuteronomy 18:1 (id: 1005018001)

1The priests, who are all from the tribe of Levi, will not receive any land in Israel. Instead, they will receive some of the food that other people offer to Yahweh.


## Deuteronomy 18:2 (id: 1005018002)

2They will not receive any land like the other tribes will. What they will receive is the honor of being Yahweh’s priests, which is what he said that they should have.


## Deuteronomy 18:3 (id: 1005018003)

3When the people bring an ox or a sheep to be sacrificed, they must give to the priests the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach of those animals.


## Deuteronomy 18:4 (id: 1005018004)

4You must also give to them the first part of the grain that you harvest, the wine and olive oil that you make, and the wool that you shear from your sheep.


## Deuteronomy 18:5 (id: 1005018005)

5You must do this because Yahweh our God has chosen the tribe of Levi from all of your tribes. He did this so that they would always be the priests who would serve him.


## Deuteronomy 18:6 (id: 1005018006)

6Suppose that a man from the tribe of Levi who has been living in one of the towns in Israel wants to live in the place of worship that Yahweh has chosen.


## Deuteronomy 18:7 (id: 1005018007)

7In that case, he is permitted to serve Yahweh there as a priest, just like the other men from the tribe of Levi who have been serving there.


## Deuteronomy 18:8 (id: 1005018008)

8He must receive the same amount of food that the other priests receive. He may keep the money that his relatives receive for selling some of their possessions {and send to him}.


## Deuteronomy 18:9 (id: 1005018009)

9When you enter the land that Yahweh our God is giving you, you must not imitate the disgusting things that the people groups who are there now do.


## Deuteronomy 18:10 (id: 1005018010)

10You must not sacrifice any of your children by burning them {on your altars}. Do not try to use magic or omens to discover what will happen in the future. Do not practice sorcery.


## Deuteronomy 18:11 (id: 1005018011)

11Do not put spells on people. Do not try to talk with spirits of dead people.


## Deuteronomy 18:12 (id: 1005018012)

12Yahweh hates people who do any of those disgusting things. And as you advance through that land, he is going to drive out the people groups because they do those disgusting things.


## Deuteronomy 18:13 (id: 1005018013)

13But you must be completely pure for Yahweh {and avoid doing any of those disgusting things}.


## Deuteronomy 18:14 (id: 1005018014)

14The people groups that you are about to expel from the land rely on magicians and psychics. But as for you, Yahweh our God does not allow you to do that.


## Deuteronomy 18:15 (id: 1005018015)

15Some day he will send from your people a prophet like me. You must obey him.


## Deuteronomy 18:16 (id: 1005018016)

16On the day that your ancestors were gathered at the bottom of Mount Sinai, they begged me for help. They told me that they did not want Yahweh to speak to them again. They did not want to see the huge fire {that burned on the mountain}. They were afraid that they would die if Yahweh spoke to them again.


## Deuteronomy 18:17 (id: 1005018017)

17Then Yahweh said to me, ‘I agree with them.


## Deuteronomy 18:18 (id: 1005018018)

18So I will send them a prophet from their people like you. I will tell him what to say, and then he will tell people everything that I tell him to say.


## Deuteronomy 18:19 (id: 1005018019)

19He will speak for me. And I will punish anyone who does not obey what he says.


## Deuteronomy 18:20 (id: 1005018020)

20There could be someone who pridefully says that he is a prophet and that his message comes from me, but I did not send him. Or, there could be someone who speaks a message that he says other gods have revealed to him. You must execute those people.’


## Deuteronomy 18:21 (id: 1005018021)

21Maybe you wonder how you can tell if a message that someone tells you does not come from Yahweh.


## Deuteronomy 18:22 (id: 1005018022)

22You will know that Yahweh did not send someone if what he said will happen in the future does not occur. That person spoke pridefully. Do not worry about what he said.


## Deuteronomy 19:1 (id: 1005019001)

1Yahweh our God will destroy the people groups from the land that he is giving to you. You will drive them out from their towns and you start to live in their homes. After that,


## Deuteronomy 19:2 (id: 1005019002)

2(2\-3\) you must divide into three parts the land that Yahweh is giving to you. Then select a city in each part. You must make good roads {in order that people can get to those cities easily}. Someone who kills another person can escape to one of those cities to be safe.


## Deuteronomy 19:4 (id: 1005019004)

4This is the rule for someone who has killed another person. If someone accidentally kills another person who was not his enemy, he may escape to one of those cities and be safe.


## Deuteronomy 19:5 (id: 1005019005)

5There could be a case where two men go into the forest to cut some wood. The axe head might come off the handle while one of the men cuts wood. Then, the ax head might hit and kill the other man. In that case, the man who was using the ax may run to one of those cities and be safe there. {The people of that city will protect him.}


## Deuteronomy 19:6 (id: 1005019006)

6{If there were only one city for the killer to run to,} the killer could be very far away from a safe city. A judge may decide not to execute the killer because the killing was an accident. Then, a relative of the victim may seek revenge and kill the man in anger before the man can arrive at a safe city.


## Deuteronomy 19:7 (id: 1005019007)

7Therefore, I order you to choose three cities {for this purpose}.


## Deuteronomy 19:8 (id: 1005019008)

8(8\-9\) Do everything that I am today commanding you to do. Love Yahweh our God and obey his instructions continually. If you do that, Yahweh our God will give you much more land {than you will have when you first inhabit the land}. You will receive all the land according to what he promised your ancestors. When that happens, select three more cities {in the new land for people to escape to}.


## Deuteronomy 19:10 (id: 1005019010)

10As a result, innocent people will not die. And you will not be guilty for allowing them to die in the land that Yahweh is giving to you.


## Deuteronomy 19:11 (id: 1005019011)

11In a case where someone hates his enemy, he might hide and wait for his enemy to pass by. Then, he might attack and murder his enemy. In this situation, if the attacker flees to one of those cities


## Deuteronomy 19:12 (id: 1005019012)

12the elders of the victim’s hometown {are responsible for punishing the attacker. They} must send someone to the city where the attacker is hiding and arrest him. Then, they must bring him to the victim’s relative, so that he may execute the attacker.


## Deuteronomy 19:13 (id: 1005019013)

13Do not pity killers! {Instead, you must execute them.} This is so that you Israelites will not be responsible for the deaths of innocent people. This is also so that you may prosper.


## Deuteronomy 19:14 (id: 1005019014)

14In the land that Yahweh is giving you, your ancestors placed stones to mark the borders of properties. When you occupy that land, do not move those markers.


## Deuteronomy 19:15 (id: 1005019015)

15If only one person testifies that someone sinned, do not punish that man. You may only punish someone for a sin if two or more people testify that they saw the man sin.


## Deuteronomy 19:16 (id: 1005019016)

16Suppose that someone falsely testifies that they saw a man sin.


## Deuteronomy 19:17 (id: 1005019017)

17Both the accuser and the accused must go to the place of worship. There, they must talk to the priests and judges who are serving at that time.


## Deuteronomy 19:18 (id: 1005019018)

18The judges must investigate the case carefully. If the judges discover that one man falsely testified against the other,


## Deuteronomy 19:19 (id: 1005019019)

19then the people must punish the false witness. The punishment must be the same as the punishment he suggested for the man that he accused. As a result, you will get rid of this evil practice from Israel.


## Deuteronomy 19:20 (id: 1005019020)

20The rest of the Israelites will learn about the punishment. They will be afraid of the punishment, so they will not testify falsely.


## Deuteronomy 19:21 (id: 1005019021)

21Do not pity that person. You must punish him as severely as he injured someone else.


## Deuteronomy 20:1 (id: 1005020001)

1When your soldiers go to fight your enemies, and you see that they have many horses and chariots and that their army is much bigger than yours, do not be afraid of them, because Yahweh our God, who brought your ancestors safely out of Egypt, will be with you.


## Deuteronomy 20:2 (id: 1005020002)

2When you are ready to start the battle, the high priest must stand in front of the troops.


## Deuteronomy 20:3 (id: 1005020003)

3He must say to them, ‘You Israelite men, listen to me! Today you are going to fight against your enemies. Do not be timid or afraid,


## Deuteronomy 20:4 (id: 1005020004)

4because Yahweh our God will go with you. He will fight your enemies for you, and he will enable you to defeat them.’


## Deuteronomy 20:5 (id: 1005020005)

5Then the army officers must say to the troops, ‘If anyone among you has just built a new house and has not dedicated it to God, he should go home and dedicate the house. If he does not do that, if he dies in the battle, someone else will dedicate the house and live in it.


## Deuteronomy 20:6 (id: 1005020006)

6If anyone among you has planted a vineyard and has not yet harvested any grapes from it, he should go home. If he stays here and dies in the battle, someone else will harvest the grapes and enjoy the wine made from them.


## Deuteronomy 20:7 (id: 1005020007)

7If anyone among you has become engaged to marry a woman but has not married her yet, he should go home. If he stays here and dies in the battle, someone else will marry her.’


## Deuteronomy 20:8 (id: 1005020008)

8Then the officers must also say, ‘If anyone among you is afraid or timid, he should go home, in order that he does not cause his fellow soldiers to also stop being courageous.’


## Deuteronomy 20:9 (id: 1005020009)

9When the officers have finished speaking to the troops, they must appoint commanders over them.


## Deuteronomy 20:10 (id: 1005020010)

10When you go up to a city that is far away to attack it, first tell the people there that if they surrender, you will not attack them.


## Deuteronomy 20:11 (id: 1005020011)

11If they open the gates of the city and surrender, they will all become your slaves to work for you.


## Deuteronomy 20:12 (id: 1005020012)

12But if they refuse to surrender peacefully and decide instead to fight against you, your troops must surround the city and break through the walls.


## Deuteronomy 20:13 (id: 1005020013)

13Then, when Yahweh our God enables you to capture the city, you must kill all the men in the city.


## Deuteronomy 20:14 (id: 1005020014)

14But you are allowed to take for yourselves the women, the children, the livestock, and everything else that you want to take from the city. You will be allowed to enjoy all the things that belonged to your enemies, the things that Yahweh our God has given to you.


## Deuteronomy 20:15 (id: 1005020015)

15You should do that in all the cities that are far from the land in which you will settle.


## Deuteronomy 20:16 (id: 1005020016)

16But in the cities that are in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you forever, you must kill all the people and all the animals.


## Deuteronomy 20:17 (id: 1005020017)

17You must get rid of them completely. Get rid of the Heth, the Amor the Canaan , the Periz, the Hiv, and the Jebus people groups; that is what Yahweh our God commanded you to do.


## Deuteronomy 20:18 (id: 1005020018)

18If you do not do that, they will teach you to sin against Yahweh our God and do the disgusting things that they do when they worship their gods.


## Deuteronomy 20:19 (id: 1005020019)

19When you surround a city for a long time, trying to capture it, do not cut down the fruit trees outside the city. You are allowed to eat the fruit from the trees, but do not destroy the trees, because they certainly are not your enemies.


## Deuteronomy 20:20 (id: 1005020020)

20You are permitted to cut down the other trees and use the wood to make ladders and towers to enable you to go over the walls and capture the city.”


## Deuteronomy 21:1 (id: 1005021001)

1“Suppose someone has been murdered in a field in the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you, and you do not know who killed that person.


## Deuteronomy 21:2 (id: 1005021002)

2If that happens, your elders and judges must go out to where that person’s corpse was found and measure the distance from there to each of the nearby towns.


## Deuteronomy 21:3 (id: 1005021003)

3Then the elders in the closest town must select a young cow that has never been used for doing work.


## Deuteronomy 21:4 (id: 1005021004)

4They must take it to a place near a stream where the ground has never been plowed or planted. There they must break its neck.


## Deuteronomy 21:5 (id: 1005021005)

5The priests must go there also, because Yahweh our God has chosen them from the tribe of Levi to serve him and to be his representatives when they bless people. And he has also chosen them to settle disputes in which someone has been injured.


## Deuteronomy 21:6 (id: 1005021006)

6The elders from the closest town must wash their hands over the young cow whose neck was broken, there in the valley,


## Deuteronomy 21:7 (id: 1005021007)

7and they must say, ‘We did not murder this person, and we did not see who did it.


## Deuteronomy 21:8 (id: 1005021008)

8Yahweh, forgive us, your Israelite people whom you rescued from Egypt. Do not consider us to be guilty. Instead, forgive us.’


## Deuteronomy 21:9 (id: 1005021009)

9By doing that, you will be doing what Yahweh considers to be right, and you will not be considered to be guilty for murdering that person.


## Deuteronomy 21:10 (id: 1005021010)

10When you who are soldiers go to fight against your enemies, and Yahweh our God enables you to defeat them, and they become your prisoners,


## Deuteronomy 21:11 (id: 1005021011)

11one of you may see among them a beautiful woman that he likes, and he may want to marry her.


## Deuteronomy 21:12 (id: 1005021012)

12He should take her to his home, and there she must shave all the hair off her head and cut her fingernails to signify that now she does not belong to her people group anymore, but now she is becoming an Israelite.


## Deuteronomy 21:13 (id: 1005021013)

13She must take off the clothes that she was wearing when she was captured, and put on Israelite clothes. She must stay in that man’s house and mourn for a month because of leaving her parents. After that, he will be allowed to marry her.


## Deuteronomy 21:14 (id: 1005021014)

14Later, if he no longer is pleased with her, he will be permitted to allow her to leave him. But because she was shamed and was forced to sleep with him, he will not be allowed to treat her like a slave and sell her to anyone else.


## Deuteronomy 21:15 (id: 1005021015)

15Suppose that a man has two wives, but he likes one of them and dislikes the other one. And suppose that they both give birth to sons, and that the oldest son is the child of the woman that he does not like.


## Deuteronomy 21:16 (id: 1005021016)

16On the day when that man decides which of his possessions each son will obtain after he dies, he must not favor the son of the wife that he loves by giving him the larger share that should go to the firstborn son.


## Deuteronomy 21:17 (id: 1005021017)

17He must give two\-thirds of his possessions to the older son, the son of the wife whom he does not like. That son is his firstborn son, and he must be given the largest share.


## Deuteronomy 21:18 (id: 1005021018)

18Suppose there is a boy who is very stubborn and is always rebelling against his parents, and who will not heed what they say to him. And suppose that they punish him but he still does not pay attention to what they tell him.


## Deuteronomy 21:19 (id: 1005021019)

19If that happens, his parents must take him to the gate of the city where they live and have him stand in front of the elders of the city.


## Deuteronomy 21:20 (id: 1005021020)

20Then the parents must say to the elders of that city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and always rebelling against us. He will not pay attention to what we tell him. He eats too much, and he gets drunk.’


## Deuteronomy 21:21 (id: 1005021021)

21Then all the elders of that city must execute him by throwing stones at him. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you. And everyone in Israel will hear about what happened and they will be afraid to do what he did.


## Deuteronomy 21:22 (id: 1005021022)

22If someone is executed for having committed a crime for which he deserves to die, and you hang his corpse on a post,


## Deuteronomy 21:23 (id: 1005021023)

23you must not allow his corpse to remain there all night. You must bury it on the day that he died, because if you keep the corpse on a post, God will curse the land. You must bury the corpse that day, in order that you do not defile the land that Yahweh our God is giving to you.


## Deuteronomy 22:1 (id: 1005022001)

1If you see an Israelite’s ox or sheep that has strayed away, do not act as though you did not see it. Take it back to its owner.


## Deuteronomy 22:2 (id: 1005022002)

2But if the owner does not live near you, or if you do not know who he is, take the animal to your house. It can stay with you until the owner comes, searching for it. Then you must give the animal to him.


## Deuteronomy 22:3 (id: 1005022003)

3You must do that same thing if you see a donkey, a piece of clothing, or anything else that someone has lost. Do not refuse to do what you should do. Do not pretend to know nothing about the matter.


## Deuteronomy 22:4 (id: 1005022004)

4And if you see a fellow Israelite’s donkey or cow that has fallen down on the road, do not act as though you did not see it. Help the owner to lift the animal up so that it can stand on its feet again.


## Deuteronomy 22:5 (id: 1005022005)

5Women must not wear men’s clothes, and men must not wear women’s clothes. Yahweh our God hates people who do things like that.


## Deuteronomy 22:6 (id: 1005022006)

6If you happen to find a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground, and the mother bird is sitting in the nest on its eggs or with the baby birds, do not take the mother bird and kill it.


## Deuteronomy 22:7 (id: 1005022007)

7You are permitted to take the baby birds, but you must allow the mother bird to fly away. Do this in order that things will go well for you and that you will live for a long time.


## Deuteronomy 22:8 (id: 1005022008)

8If you build a new house, you must put a railing around the roof. In this way, you will not be guilty of having caused someone’s death if a person falls from it and dies.


## Deuteronomy 22:9 (id: 1005022009)

9Do not plant any crop in the area where your grapevines are growing. If you do, the priests in Yahweh’s sanctuary will seize both the seed and the harvest of that vineyard.

11Do not wear clothing that is made by weaving together wool and linen.


## Deuteronomy 22:12 (id: 1005022012)

12Twist threads together to make tassels and sew them on the four bottom corners of your cloak.


## Deuteronomy 22:13 (id: 1005022013)

13Suppose a man marries a young woman and sleeps with her and later decides that he does not want her anymore,


## Deuteronomy 22:14 (id: 1005022014)

14and suppose that he says false things about her, and claims that she was not a virgin when he married her.


## Deuteronomy 22:15 (id: 1005022015)

15If that happens, the young woman’s parents must take the sheet that was on the bed when the man and their daughter were married, which still has bloodstains on it, and show it to the elders of the city at the gate of the city.


## Deuteronomy 22:16 (id: 1005022016)

16Then the father of the young woman must say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife. But now he says that he does not want her anymore.


## Deuteronomy 22:17 (id: 1005022017)

17And he has falsely said that she was not a virgin when he married her. But look! Here is what proves that my daughter was a virgin! Look at the bloodstains on the sheet where they slept the night that they were married!’ And he will show the sheet to the elders.


## Deuteronomy 22:18 (id: 1005022018)

18Then the elders of that city must take that man and whip him.


## Deuteronomy 22:19 (id: 1005022019)

19They shall require that he pay a fine of one hundred pieces of silver and give the money to the father of the young woman, because the man has brought shame on an Israelite young woman. Also, that woman must continue to live with him; she is his wife. He is not allowed to divorce her during the rest of his life.


## Deuteronomy 22:20 (id: 1005022020)

20But if what the man said is true, and there is nothing to prove that she was a virgin when he married her,


## Deuteronomy 22:21 (id: 1005022021)

21they must take that young woman to the door of her father’s house. Then the men of that city must execute her by throwing stones at her. They must do that because she has done something in Israel that is very disgraceful, by sleeping with some man while she was still living in her father’s house. By executing her like that, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you.


## Deuteronomy 22:22 (id: 1005022022)

22If a man is caught while he is sleeping with another man’s wife, both of them must be executed. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice from Israel.


## Deuteronomy 22:23 (id: 1005022023)

23Suppose in some town a man sees a young woman who is promised to be married to another man, and he is caught sleeping with her.


## Deuteronomy 22:24 (id: 1005022024)

24You must take both of them to the gate of that town, where the town leaders decide important matters. There you must execute them both by throwing stones at them. You must execute the young woman because she did not shout for help even though she was in the town. And the man must be executed because he slept with someone who was already promised to be married. By doing that, you will get rid of this evil practice from among you


## Deuteronomy 22:25 (id: 1005022025)

25But suppose out in the open countryside a man meets a young woman who is engaged to be married, and he forces her to sleep with him. If that happens, only that man must be executed.


## Deuteronomy 22:26 (id: 1005022026)

26You must not punish the young woman, because she did not do anything for which she deserves to be executed. This case is like when one man attacks another man in the countryside and murders him,


## Deuteronomy 22:27 (id: 1005022027)

27because the man who forced her to sleep with him saw her when she was in the open countryside, and even though she called out for help, there was no one there who could rescue her.


## Deuteronomy 22:28 (id: 1005022028)

28If a man forces a young woman who is not engaged to be married to sleep with him, and if someone sees him while he is doing that,


## Deuteronomy 22:29 (id: 1005022029)

29that man must pay fifty pieces of silver to the young woman’s father, and he must marry her, because he shamed her by forcing her to sleep with him. He is not allowed to divorce her during the rest of his life.


## Deuteronomy 22:30 (id: 1005022030)

30A man must not take what belongs to his father by sleeping with any of his father’s wives.


## Deuteronomy 23:1 (id: 1005023001)

1Any male person whose reproductive organs have been destroyed may not be included as one of Yahweh’s people.


## Deuteronomy 23:2 (id: 1005023002)

2No illegitimate person or descendant of an illegitimate person, extending to the tenth generation, shall be included as one of Yahweh’s people.


## Deuteronomy 23:3 (id: 1005023003)

3No one from the Ammon or Moab people groups shall be included as one of Yahweh’s people, extending to the tenth generation.


## Deuteronomy 23:4 (id: 1005023004)

4One reason for this is that their leaders refused to give your ancestors food and water when they were traveling from Egypt to Canaan. Another reason is that they paid Balaam son of Beor from the town of Pethor in Mesopotamia, to curse you Israelites.


## Deuteronomy 23:5 (id: 1005023005)

5But Yahweh our God did not pay attention to Balaam; instead, he caused Balaam to bless your ancestors, because Yahweh loved them.


## Deuteronomy 23:6 (id: 1005023006)

6As long as Israel is a nation, you must not do anything to cause things to go well for those two people groups to enable them to prosper.

## Deuteronomy 25:9 (id: 1005025009)

9In that case, she must go up to him while the elders are watching, and take off one of his sandals to symbolize that he would not receive any of her property, spit in his face, and say to him, ‘This is what happens to the man who refuses to do what is needed to allow his dead brother to have a son in order that our family name does not disappear.’

## Deuteronomy 26:7 (id: 1005026007)

7Then our ancestors cried out to you, Yahweh our God, and you heard them. You saw that they were suffering, and that they were forced to work very hard, and were being oppressed.

8Then by your great power and by performing many kinds of miracles, and other terrifying things, you brought them out of Egypt.

9You brought us to this land and gave it to us, a land that is very fertile.


## Deuteronomy 26:10 (id: 1005026010)

10So now, Yahweh, I have brought to you the first part of the harvest from the land that I received.’ Then you must set the basket down in Yahweh’s presence and worship him there.


## Deuteronomy 26:11 (id: 1005026011)

13Then you must say to Yahweh, ‘I have brought to you, from my house, all of the tenth from my harvest this year, the tenth that I have set aside for you. I am giving it to the descendants of Levi, to the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows, as you commanded us to do. I have not disobeyed any of your commands about the tenth portion, and I have not forgotten any of your commands about it.


## Deuteronomy 26:14 (id: 1005026014)

14I declare that I have not eaten any food from the tenth portion while I was mourning for someone who died.

Yahweh, I have obeyed you and done everything that you have commanded us concerning the tenth portion.


## Deuteronomy 26:15 (id: 1005026015)

15So please look down from your holy place in heaven, and bless us, your Israelite people. Also bless this very fertile land which you have given to us, which is what you promised our ancestors that you would do.’

6The altar that you make to burn sacrifices to Yahweh our God must be made with uncut stones.

23No rain will fall from the sky, with the result that the ground will be as hard as iron.

## Deuteronomy 28:27 (id: 1005028027)

## Deuteronomy 28:30 (id: 1005028030)

## Deuteronomy 28:31 (id: 1005028031)

31Your enemies will butcher your cattle while you watch them, and you will not get any of the meat to eat. They will drag away your donkeys while you watch them do it, and they will not give them back to you. They will take away your sheep; and there will not be anyone to help you rescue them.


## Deuteronomy 28:32 (id: 1005028032)

## Deuteronomy 28:37 (id: 1005028037)

37When the people groups in nearby countries see what has happened to you, they will be shocked; they will taunt you and make fun of you in every place where Yahweh drives you.


## Deuteronomy 28:38 (id: 1005028038)

38You will plant plenty of seeds in your fields, but you will reap only a small harvest, because locusts will eat the crops.


## Deuteronomy 28:39 (id: 1005028039)

## Deuteronomy 28:45 (id: 1005028045)

46These disasters will solemnly warn you and your descendants forever what happens to groups who disobey Yahweh.

## Deuteronomy 28:48 (id: 1005028048)

## Deuteronomy 28:54 (id: 1005028054)

54(54\-55\) When your enemies have surrounded your towns, even the most gentle and sensitive men among you will want food very desperately, with the result that they will kill their own children and eat their flesh, because they will not have anything else to eat. They will not even share any of it with their brothers or wives whom they love very much or with any of their other children who are still alive.


## Deuteronomy 28:56 (id: 1005028056)

56(56\-57\) Even the most gentle and kind women among you, who are very rich with the result that they have never been forced to walk anywhere, will do the same thing. When your enemies have surrounded your towns, those women will be extremely hungry, with the result that after they give birth to a child, they will secretly kill the baby and eat its flesh and also eat the afterbirth.

62You became as numerous as the stars in the sky, but only a few of you will remain alive, if you do not obey Yahweh your God.


## Deuteronomy 28:63 (id: 1005028063)

63Yahweh was very happy to do good things for you and to cause you to become very numerous, but now he will be happy to ruin you and get rid of you. Those of you who do not die from these plagues will be snatched away from the land that you will soon be entering to possess.


## Deuteronomy 28:64 (id: 1005028064)

64Yahweh will scatter you among many people groups, all over the earth, and in those places you will worship other gods that are made of wood or stone, gods which you and your ancestors have never known.

## Deuteronomy 29:1 (id: 1005029001)

1These are the covenantal commands of Yahweh that the Israelites were required to obey. When they were in the region of Moab on the east side of the Jordan River, Moses commanded them to keep these regulations. These regulations became part of the covenant that Yahweh had made with them at Mount Sinai.


## Deuteronomy 29:2 (id: 1005029002)

2Moses summoned all the Israelite people and said to them, “You saw for yourselves what Yahweh did to the king of Egypt and to his officials and to his entire country.


## Deuteronomy 29:3 (id: 1005029003)

3You saw all the plagues that Yahweh sent on them, and all the various miracles that he performed.


## Deuteronomy 29:4 (id: 1005029004)

4But to this day, Yahweh has not enabled you to understand the meaning of all that you have seen and heard.


## Deuteronomy 29:5 (id: 1005029005)

5For forty years Yahweh has led you while you traveled through the desert. During that time, your clothes and your sandals have not worn out.


## Deuteronomy 29:6 (id: 1005029006)

6You did not have bread to eat or wine or other fermented drinks to drink, but Yahweh took care of you, in order that you would know that he is your God.


## Deuteronomy 29:7 (id: 1005029007)

7And when we came to this place, Sihon, the king who ruled in the city of Heshbon, and Og, the king who ruled the region of Bashan, came out with their armies to attack us, but we defeated them.


## Deuteronomy 29:8 (id: 1005029008)

8We took their land and divided it among the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh.


## Deuteronomy 29:9 (id: 1005029009)

9So obey faithfully all of this covenant, in order that you will prosper in everything that you do.


## Deuteronomy 29:10 (id: 1005029010)

10Today all of us are standing in the presence of Yahweh our God—I, the leaders of all your tribes, your elders, your officials, all you Israelite men,


## Deuteronomy 29:11 (id: 1005029011)

11your wives, your children, and the foreigners who live among us and cut wood for us and carry water for us.


## Deuteronomy 29:12 (id: 1005029012)

12You are all here today to agree to accept this covenant with Yahweh, and to bind yourselves to it.


## Deuteronomy 29:13 (id: 1005029013)

13He is making this agreement with you in order to make sure that you are his people, and that he is your God. This is what he promised to do for you, and what he solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that he would do.


## Deuteronomy 29:14 (id: 1005029014)

14This covenant is not only with you.


## Deuteronomy 29:15 (id: 1005029015)

15God is making this agreement with us who are here today and also with our descendants who are not yet born.


## Deuteronomy 29:16 (id: 1005029016)

16You remember the things that our ancestors suffered in Egypt, and how they traveled through the land that belonged to other nations after they came out of Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 29:17 (id: 1005029017)

17In those countries they saw those disgusting idols made of wood and stone and decorated with silver and gold.


## Deuteronomy 29:18 (id: 1005029018)

18So be sure that no man or woman or family or tribe that is here today turns away from Yahweh our God, to worship any of the gods of those people groups. If you do that, you will bring disaster on yourselves.


## Deuteronomy 29:19 (id: 1005029019)

19Be sure that no one here today who hears the words of this covenant says to himself, ‘Everything will go well with me, even if I stubbornly do what I want to.’ If you do that, the result will be that Yahweh will eventually destroy all of you, both good people and evil people.


## Deuteronomy 29:20 (id: 1005029020)

20Yahweh will not forgive anyone who is stubborn like that. Instead, he will be extremely angry with that person, and all the curses that I have told you about will happen to that person, until Yahweh destroys that person and his family forever.


## Deuteronomy 29:21 (id: 1005029021)

21From all the tribes of Israel, Yahweh will choose that individual to suffer all the disasters that I have listed in the covenant—all the bad things that will happen to anyone whom Yahweh curses for disobeying the laws that I have written in this scroll.


## Deuteronomy 29:22 (id: 1005029022)

22In future years, your descendants and people from other countries will see the disasters and the illnesses that Yahweh has caused to happen to you.


## Deuteronomy 29:23 (id: 1005029023)

23They will see that all your land has been ruined by burning sulfur and salt. Nothing will have been planted. Not even weeds will be there. Your land will resemble the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities of Admah and Zeboyim, which Yahweh destroyed when he was very angry with those people.


## Deuteronomy 29:24 (id: 1005029024)

24And the people from those other nations will ask, ‘Why did Yahweh do this to this land? Why was he so angry with the people who lived here?’


## Deuteronomy 29:25 (id: 1005029025)

25Then other people will reply, ‘It is because they refused to obey the covenant that they had made with Yahweh, the God whom their ancestors worshiped, when he brought them out of Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 29:26 (id: 1005029026)

26Instead, they wroshiped other gods that they had never worshiped before, gods that Yahweh had not told them to worship.


## Deuteronomy 29:27 (id: 1005029027)

27So Yahweh became very angry with the people of this land, and he has caused to happen to them all the disasters that their leader warned them about.


## Deuteronomy 29:28 (id: 1005029028)

28Yahweh became extremely angry with them and took them out of their land, and threw them into another land, and they are still there.’


## Deuteronomy 29:29 (id: 1005029029)

29There are some things that Yahweh our God has kept secret, but he has revealed his law to us, and he expects us and our descendants to obey it forever.


## Deuteronomy 30:1 (id: 1005030001)

1I have now told you about the ways that Yahweh our God will bless you if you obey him and the ways that he will curse you if you disobey him. But if you choose not to obey his laws, some day you will be living in the countries to which he will have scattered you, and you will remember what I told you.


## Deuteronomy 30:2 (id: 1005030002)

2Then, if you and your children begin to worship Yahweh our God and faithfully obey all that I have today commanded you to do,


## Deuteronomy 30:3 (id: 1005030003)

3he will again act mercifully toward you. He will bring you back from the nations to which he scattered you, and he will cause you to be prosperous again.


## Deuteronomy 30:4 (id: 1005030004)

4Even if you have been scattered to the most distant places on the earth, Yahweh our God will gather you from there and bring you back to your land.


## Deuteronomy 30:5 (id: 1005030005)

5He will enable you to possess again the land where your ancestors lived. And he will cause you to be more prosperous and more numerous than you are now.


## Deuteronomy 30:6 (id: 1005030006)

6Yahweh our God will change your inner beings, with the result that you will love him with all that you desire and with all that you feel. And then you will continue to live in that land.


## Deuteronomy 30:7 (id: 1005030007)

7Yahweh our God will send all the disasters that I have told you about on your enemies and on those who oppressed you.


## Deuteronomy 30:8 (id: 1005030008)

8As you did before, you will do what Yahweh wants you to do, and you will obey all the commands that I have given to you today.


## Deuteronomy 30:9 (id: 1005030009)

9Yahweh our God will cause you to be very prosperous in all that you do. You will have many children and many cattle, and you will produce abundant crops. He will again be happy to enable you to prosper, just like he was happy to enable your ancestors to prosper.


## Deuteronomy 30:10 (id: 1005030010)

10But he will do those things only if you do what he has told you to do, and only if you obey all his rules and regulations that I have written about in this book, and only if you turn to Yahweh with all that you desire and with all that you feel.


## Deuteronomy 30:11 (id: 1005030011)

11The commands that I am giving to you today are not very difficult for you to obey, and they are not difficult to know.


## Deuteronomy 30:12 (id: 1005030012)

12They are not hidden in heaven. You do not need to say, ‘Who can go up to heaven for us to bring them down here to us so we can learn them?’


## Deuteronomy 30:13 (id: 1005030013)

13And they are not on the other side of the sea. You do not need to say, ‘Who will cross the sea for us and bring them back to us, so we can learn them?’


## Deuteronomy 30:14 (id: 1005030014)

14No, his commands are here with you. You know them, and you can say them again and again. So you can easily obey them.


## Deuteronomy 30:15 (id: 1005030015)

15So listen! Today I am allowing you to choose between doing what is evil and doing what is good, between what will enable you to live for a long time and what will cause you to die while you are still young.


## Deuteronomy 30:16 (id: 1005030016)

16I say again, if you obey the decrees of Yahweh our God that I am giving to you today, and if you love him and conduct your lives as he wants you to do, and if you obey all his rules and regulations, you will prosper and become very numerous, and Yahweh our God will bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess.


## Deuteronomy 30:17 (id: 1005030017)

17But if you stop worshiping Yahweh, and if you refuse to obey what he says, and if you allow others to persuade you to worship other gods,


## Deuteronomy 30:18 (id: 1005030018)

18I am warning you today that you will soon die. Your people will not live for very long in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan River to enter and possess.


## Deuteronomy 30:19 (id: 1005030019)

19I am requesting everyone in heaven and on the earth to testify to you, that today I am allowing you to choose whether you want to live for a long time or to soon die, whether you want Yahweh to bless you or to curse you. So choose to live.


## Deuteronomy 30:20 (id: 1005030020)

20Decide to love Yahweh our God and to obey him. If you do that, you and your descendants will live for a long time in the land that Yahweh solemnly promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give to them.”


## Deuteronomy 31:1 (id: 1005031001)

1When Moses finished saying all that to the Israelite people,


## Deuteronomy 31:2 (id: 1005031002)

2“I am 120 years old. I am no longer able to go everywhere that you need to go, so I cannot be your leader any longer. Furthermore, Yahweh has told me that I will not cross the Jordan River.


## Deuteronomy 31:3 (id: 1005031003)

3But Yahweh our God will go ahead of you. He will enable you to destroy the nations that are living there, in order that you can occupy their land. Joshua will be your leader, which is what Yahweh has already told me.


## Deuteronomy 31:4 (id: 1005031004)

4Yahweh will do to those nations what he did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amor people group when he destroyed their armies and their people groups.


## Deuteronomy 31:5 (id: 1005031005)

5Yahweh will enable you to conquer those people groups, but you must kill all of those people, which is what I have commanded you to do.


## Deuteronomy 31:6 (id: 1005031006)

6Be brave and confident. Do not be afraid of those people. Do not forget that it is Yahweh our God who will go with you. He will always help you and never abandon you.”


## Deuteronomy 31:7 (id: 1005031007)

7Then Moses called Joshua to his side and said to him, “Be brave and confident. You are the one who will lead these people into the land that Yahweh promised to our ancestors that he would give to them, and you will enable them to occupy it.


## Deuteronomy 31:8 (id: 1005031008)

8It is Yahweh who will go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will always help you. He will never abandon you. So do not be afraid or dismayed.”


## Deuteronomy 31:9 (id: 1005031009)

9Moses wrote down all these laws and gave the scroll to the priests, who carried the sacred chest. He also gave the scroll to all the Israelite elders.


## Deuteronomy 31:10 (id: 1005031010)

10Moses told them, “At the end of every seven years, at the time that all debts are canceled, read this to the people during the Festival of Shelters.


## Deuteronomy 31:11 (id: 1005031011)

11Read it to all the Israelite people when they gather at the place that Yahweh chooses for them to worship him.


## Deuteronomy 31:12 (id: 1005031012)

12Gather together everyone—men, women, children, even the foreigners who are living in your towns—in order that they may hear these laws and learn to have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God, and to faithfully obey everything that is written in these laws.


## Deuteronomy 31:13 (id: 1005031013)

13If they do that, your descendants, who have never known these laws, will hear them and will also learn to have an awesome respect for Yahweh our God, during all the years that they live in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan River to occupy.”


## Deuteronomy 31:14 (id: 1005031014)

14Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Listen carefully. You will soon die. Summon Joshua, and you will go to the sacred tent with him, in order that I may appoint him to be the new leader.” So Joshua and Moses went to the sacred tent.


## Deuteronomy 31:15 (id: 1005031015)

15There Yahweh appeared to them in a pillar of cloud, and that cloud was over the entrance to the tent.


## Deuteronomy 31:16 (id: 1005031016)

16Yahweh said to Moses, “You will soon die. Then these people will become unfaithful to me. They will stop obeying the covenant that I made with them. They will begin to worship the foreign gods that are worshiped by the people of the land that they will enter.


## Deuteronomy 31:17 (id: 1005031017)

17When that happens, I will become very angry with them. I will abandon them and refuse to help them any longer. Many bad things will happen to them, and they will be destroyed. Then they will say among themselves, ‘These things are happening to us because our God is no longer with us.’


## Deuteronomy 31:18 (id: 1005031018)

18And because of all the evil things that they will have done, and especially because they will have started to worship other gods, I will refuse to help them.


## Deuteronomy 31:19 (id: 1005031019)

19So I am going to give you, Moses, a song. Write it on a scroll and teach it to the Israelite people and make them memorize it. It will be like a witness that accuses them.


## Deuteronomy 31:20 (id: 1005031020)

20I am about to take them into a very fertile land, a land that I solemnly promised their ancestors that I would give to them. There they will have plenty to eat, with the result that their stomachs will always be full and they will become fat. But then they will turn to other gods and start to worship them, and they will despise me and break the covenant that I have made with them.


## Deuteronomy 31:21 (id: 1005031021)

21And many terrible disasters will happen to them. After that happens, their descendants will remember this song, and it will be like a witness that says, ‘Now you know why Yahweh punished your ancestors.’ I will soon take them into the land that I solemnly promised that I would give to them; but even now, before I do that, I know what they are thinking that they will do when they are living there.”


## Deuteronomy 31:22 (id: 1005031022)

22So on the very day that Yahweh gave Moses that song, Moses also taught it to the Israelite people.


## Deuteronomy 31:23 (id: 1005031023)

23Then Yahweh appointed Joshua as leader and said to him, “Be brave and confident, because you will lead the Israelite people into the land that I solemnly promised that I would give to them. And I will be with you.”


## Deuteronomy 31:24 (id: 1005031024)

24Moses finished writing all the law onto a scroll.


## Deuteronomy 31:25 (id: 1005031025)

25Then he told the descendants of Levi, who were carrying the Sacred Chest that contained the Ten Commandments,


## Deuteronomy 31:26 (id: 1005031026)

26“Take this scroll on which these laws are written, and place it beside the Sacred Chest that contains the covenant that Yahweh our God made with you, in order that it may remain there to testify about what Yahweh will do to the people if they disobey him.


## Deuteronomy 31:27 (id: 1005031027)

27I say this because I know that these people are very stubborn. They have rebelled against Yahweh all during the time that I have been with them, and they will rebel much more after I die!


## Deuteronomy 31:28 (id: 1005031028)

28So gather all the elders of the tribes and your officials, in order that I can teach them the words of this song, and so that I can request all those who are in heaven and on the earth to be witnesses to testify against these people.


## Deuteronomy 31:29 (id: 1005031029)

29I say this, because I know that after I die, the people will become very wicked. They will stop doing everything that I have commanded them to do. And in the future, because of all the evil things that they will do, they will cause Yahweh to become angry with them. Then he will cause them to experience disasters.”


## Deuteronomy 31:30 (id: 1005031030)

30Then, while all the Israelite people listened, Moses sang this entire song to them:


## Deuteronomy 32:1 (id: 1005032001)

1“Listen to me, all you who are in the heavens, and all you who are on the earth, listen to what I say.


## Deuteronomy 32:2 (id: 1005032002)

2I wish that my song may help you like the rain helps you, or like the dew on the ground in the morning, or like a gentle rain on the young plants, like showers of rain on the grass.


## Deuteronomy 32:3 (id: 1005032003)

3I will praise Yahweh. And all you people should praise how great our God is.


## Deuteronomy 32:4 (id: 1005032004)

4He is like a rock on top of which we are protected; everything that he does is perfect and completely just. He always does what he says that he will do; he never does anything that is wrong.


## Deuteronomy 32:5 (id: 1005032005)

5But you Israelite people have been very unfaithful to him; because of your sins, you no longer deserve to be his children. You are extremely wicked and deceitful.


## Deuteronomy 32:6 (id: 1005032006)

6You foolish and senseless people, is this the way that you should repay Yahweh for all that he has done for you? He is your father; he created you; he caused you to become a nation.


## Deuteronomy 32:7 (id: 1005032007)

7Think about what happened long ago; consider what happened to your ancestors. Ask your parents, and they will inform you; ask the older people, and they will tell you.


## Deuteronomy 32:8 (id: 1005032008)

8When God, who is greater than any other god, long ago divided the people into groups, he assigned to the nations their land. He determined where each people group should live and limited to each people group their own gods.


## Deuteronomy 32:9 (id: 1005032009)

9But Yahweh decided that we would be his people; he chose us, the descendants of Jacob, to belong to him.


## Deuteronomy 32:10 (id: 1005032010)

10He saw our ancestors when they were in a desert, wandering in a land that was desolate. He protected them and took care of them, as every person takes good care of his own eyes.


## Deuteronomy 32:11 (id: 1005032011)

11Yahweh protected his people just like an eagle encourages its babies to fly and flutters over them, spreading its wings and catching them if they start to fall.


## Deuteronomy 32:12 (id: 1005032012)

12Yahweh was the only one who led them; no other foreign god helped them.


## Deuteronomy 32:13 (id: 1005032013)

13After they entered the land that Yahweh promised to give to them, Yahweh enabled them to rule the hill country; they ate the crops that grew in the fields. They found honey in the rocks, and their olive trees grew even in stony ground.


## Deuteronomy 32:14 (id: 1005032014)

14The cows gave them plenty of curds; the goats gave them plenty of milk, they had well fed sheep and cattle, they had very good wheat, and they made delicious wine from their grapes.


## Deuteronomy 32:15 (id: 1005032015)

15The Israelite people became rich and prosperous, but then they rebelled against God; they abandoned him, the one who created them, the one who powerfully saves them.


## Deuteronomy 32:16 (id: 1005032016)

16He abandoned them because they started to worship other gods. Because of their worshiping disgusting idols, he became angry.


## Deuteronomy 32:17 (id: 1005032017)

17They offered sacrifices to gods who were really demons, gods that their ancestors had never known; they offered sacrifices to gods that they had recently found out about, gods whom your ancestors had never had any respect for.


## Deuteronomy 32:18 (id: 1005032018)

18They forgot the true God, the one who protects them, the one who created them and caused them to live.


## Deuteronomy 32:19 (id: 1005032019)

19When Yahweh saw that they had abandoned him, he became angry, so he rejected the Israelite people who were like his sons and daughters.


## Deuteronomy 32:20 (id: 1005032020)

20He said, ‘They are very wicked people, very unfaithful; so I will no longer help them, and then I will watch and see what happens to them.


## Deuteronomy 32:21 (id: 1005032021)

21Because they now are worshiping idols, which are not really gods, they have caused me to be like a jealous husband because I want them to worship only me. So now, in order to cause them to become angry, I will now send to attack them an army of a nation of worthless and foolish people.


## Deuteronomy 32:22 (id: 1005032022)

22I will be very angry, and I will destroy them like a fire that will burn all the way down to the place where dead people are; that fire will destroy the earth and everything that grows on it, and it will even burn what is down under the mountains.


## Deuteronomy 32:23 (id: 1005032023)

23I will pile up on them many disasters; they will feel as though I am shooting all my arrows on them.


## Deuteronomy 32:24 (id: 1005032024)

24They will die because of being hungry and because of having hot fevers and because of terrible diseases; I will send wild animals to attack them, and poisonous snakes to bite them.


## Deuteronomy 32:25 (id: 1005032025)

25Outside their houses, their enemies will kill them with swords, and in their homes, their enemies will cause them to be terrified. Their enemies will kill young men and young women, and they will kill infants and old people with gray hair.


## Deuteronomy 32:26 (id: 1005032026)

26I wanted only to scatter them to distant countries in order that no one would ever remember them.


## Deuteronomy 32:27 (id: 1005032027)

27But if I did that, their enemies would wrongly boast that they were the ones who had gotten rid of my people; they would say, “We are the ones who defeated them; it was not Yahweh who has done all these things.”’


## Deuteronomy 32:28 (id: 1005032028)

28You Israelites are a nation of people who do not have any sense. None of you are wise.


## Deuteronomy 32:29 (id: 1005032029)

29If you were wise, you would understand why you would be punished; you would have realized what was going to happen to you.


## Deuteronomy 32:30 (id: 1005032030)

30You would have realized why a thousand of your soldiers would be defeated by only one of the enemy soldiers, and why two of your enemies would chase away ten thousand Israelite soldiers. You would realize that this would happen only if God, the one who always defended you, had put you in the hands of your enemies, that Yahweh had abandoned you.


## Deuteronomy 32:31 (id: 1005032031)

31Your enemies know that their gods are not powerful like Yahweh, our God, so their gods could not have defeated us Israelites.


## Deuteronomy 32:32 (id: 1005032032)

32Your enemies are like grapevines planted near the ruins of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah; the grapes from those vines are bitter and poisonous.


## Deuteronomy 32:33 (id: 1005032033)

33The wine from those grapes is like the poison of snakes.


## Deuteronomy 32:34 (id: 1005032034)

34Yahweh says, ‘I know what I have planned to do to the Israelite people and to their enemies, and I have locked up those plans as someone would lock up his valuable possessions.


## Deuteronomy 32:35 (id: 1005032035)

35I am the one who will get revenge and pay those enemies back for what they have done to my people, at the right time for them to be punished; they will soon experience disasters, and I will punish them quickly.’


## Deuteronomy 32:36 (id: 1005032036)

36But Yahweh will say that you who are truly his people are innocent, and he will act mercifully toward you who serve him, when he sees that you are helpless, and that there are very few of you, slaves or free people, who are still alive.


## Deuteronomy 32:37 (id: 1005032037)

37Then Yahweh will ask you, ‘Where are the gods that you thought would protect you?


## Deuteronomy 32:38 (id: 1005032038)

38You gave to those gods the best parts of the animals that you sacrificed, and you poured out wine for them to drink. So they should rise and help you; they should be the ones who will protect you!


## Deuteronomy 32:39 (id: 1005032039)

39But now you will realize that I, only I, am God; there is no other god who is a real god. I am the one who can kill people and who can cause people to live; I can wound people, and I can heal people, and there is no one who can prevent me from doing those things.


## Deuteronomy 32:40 (id: 1005032040)

40I raise my hand toward heaven and solemnly declare that just as sure as I live forever, I will act.


## Deuteronomy 32:41 (id: 1005032041)

41When I sharpen my sword and prepare to punish people, I will get revenge on my enemies, and I will pay back those who hate me.


## Deuteronomy 32:42 (id: 1005032042)

42I will kill all of my enemies with a sword; it will be as though I had arrows that were covered with their blood. I will kill all those whom I capture and cut off their heads.’


## Deuteronomy 32:43 (id: 1005032043)

43You people of all nations, you should praise Yahweh’s people, because Yahweh gets revenge on those who kill the people who serve him, and he cleanses his people’s land which has become defiled because of their sins.”


## Deuteronomy 32:44 (id: 1005032044)

44Joshua and Moses sang that song while the Israelite people were listening.


## Deuteronomy 32:45 (id: 1005032045)

45Then they finished singing to them this song.


## Deuteronomy 32:46 (id: 1005032046)

46Moses said, “Never forget all these commands that I have been giving you today. Teach these laws to your children, in order that they will faithfully obey all of them.


## Deuteronomy 32:47 (id: 1005032047)

47These instructions are very important. If you obey them, you will live a long time in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan River to occupy.”


## Deuteronomy 32:48 (id: 1005032048)

48On that same day, Yahweh said to Moses,


## Deuteronomy 32:49 (id: 1005032049)

49“Go to the Abarim mountain range here in the region of Moab, across from Jericho. Climb Mount Nebo and look toward the west to see Canaan, the land that I am about to give to the Israelite people.


## Deuteronomy 32:50 (id: 1005032050)

50You will die on that mountain, like your older brother Aaron died on Mount Hor.


## Deuteronomy 32:51 (id: 1005032051)

51You will die because both of you disobeyed me in the presence of the Israelite people, when you all were at the springs of Meribah near Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You did not honor and respect me in the presence of the Israelite people in the way that I deserve because I am God.


## Deuteronomy 32:52 (id: 1005032052)

52When you are on that mountain where I told you to go, you will see in the distance in front of you the land that I am about to give to the Israelite people, but you will not enter it.”


## Deuteronomy 33:1 (id: 1005033001)

1Before God’s prophet Moses died, he asked God to bless the Israelite people.


## Deuteronomy 33:2 (id: 1005033002)

2This is what he said: “Yahweh came and spoke to us at Mount Sinai; he came like the sun rises in the region of Edom and like his light shone on us when we were in the desert near Mount Paran after we left Mount Sinai. He came with ten thousand angels, and there was a flaming fire at his right side.


## Deuteronomy 33:3 (id: 1005033003)

3Yahweh truly loves his people and protects all those who belong to him. So they prostrate themselves in front of him, and they listen to his instructions.


## Deuteronomy 33:4 (id: 1005033004)

4I gave them laws to obey, laws that would forever be for the descendants of Jacob.


## Deuteronomy 33:5 (id: 1005033005)

5So Yahweh became the king of his Israelite people when all the tribes and their leaders had gathered together.


## Deuteronomy 33:6 (id: 1005033006)

6I say this about the tribe of Reuben: I desire that their tribe will never disappear, but that they will never become numerous.


## Deuteronomy 33:7 (id: 1005033007)

7I say this about the tribe of Judah: Yahweh, listen to them when they call out for help; and after they separate from the other tribes, unite them with the other tribes again. Fight for them, and help them to fight against their enemies.


## Deuteronomy 33:8 (id: 1005033008)

8I say this about the tribe of Levi: Yahweh, give to those who are dedicated to you the sacred stones that they will use to find out what you want to be done; You tested them at a spring in the desert, a spring that they named Massah and also named Meribah to find out if they would remain loyal to you.


## Deuteronomy 33:9 (id: 1005033009)

9The tribe of Levi did what you told them to do and obeyed the covenant that you had made with the Israelite people; those laws were more important to them than their siblings and parents and children.


## Deuteronomy 33:10 (id: 1005033010)

10The tribe of Levi will teach the Israelite people your decrees and your laws, and they are the ones who will burn incense and who will completely burn on the altar the offerings that the people bring.


## Deuteronomy 33:11 (id: 1005033011)

11Yahweh, bless their work and accept all that they do. Crush all their enemies; do not enable their enemies to be able to fight against them again.


## Deuteronomy 33:12 (id: 1005033012)

12I say this about the tribe of Benjamin: They are the tribe that Yahweh loves; he keeps them safe. He protects them continually, and he lives among their hills.


## Deuteronomy 33:13 (id: 1005033013)

13I say this about the tribes of Joseph: I desire that Yahweh will bless their land by giving them rain from the sky and water from deep down in the ground.


## Deuteronomy 33:14 (id: 1005033014)

14I desire that Yahweh will bless their land by giving them good fruit ripened by the sun and good crops in the right months.


## Deuteronomy 33:15 (id: 1005033015)

15I desire that Yahweh give them that very nice fruit that will grow on trees in their ancient mountains.


## Deuteronomy 33:16 (id: 1005033016)

16I desire that Yahweh will bless their land and that he fill the land with many good crops. I desire that Yahweh will bless the tribes of Joseph in all those ways, because he was the leader over his older brothers when they were in Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 33:17 (id: 1005033017)

17The descendants of Joseph will be as strong as a bull; with their weapons they will wound their enemies like a wild ox gores other animals with its horns. They will push other people groups, all of them, to the most distant places on the earth. That is what the descendants of the two sons of Joseph will do, the ten thousands of the tribe of Ephraim and the thousands of the tribe of Manasseh.


## Deuteronomy 33:18 (id: 1005033018)

18I say this about the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar: I desire that the people of Zebulun will prosper in their travels across the seas, and that the people of Issachar will prosper while they stay at home and take care of their cattle and crops.


## Deuteronomy 33:19 (id: 1005033019)

19They will invite people from the other Israelite tribes to the mountain where they worship Yahweh, and they will offer correct sacrifices to him. They will become rich from the trade that they carry out on the seas and from using the sand along the sea to make things.


## Deuteronomy 33:20 (id: 1005033020)

20I say this about the tribe of Gad: Praise Yahweh, the one who made their territory large. The people of their tribe will attack their enemies fiercely like a lion that crouches, waiting to tear off the arm or the scalp of some animal.


## Deuteronomy 33:21 (id: 1005033021)

21They chose the best part of the land for themselves; a large share of the land, a share that should be given to a leader was allotted to them. When the leaders of the tribes of Israel gathered together, they decided that the tribe of Gad should have a large share of the land. The tribe of Gad obeyed the commands of Yahweh and the things that he decided that they should do.


## Deuteronomy 33:22 (id: 1005033022)

22I say this about the tribe of Dan: The people of the tribe of Dan are like a young lion; they leap out from their caves in the region of Bashan to attack their enemies.


## Deuteronomy 33:23 (id: 1005033023)

23I say this about the tribe of Naphtali: The people of the tribe of Naphtali have been blessed by Yahweh, who has been very kind to them; their land extends far south from Lake Galilee.


## Deuteronomy 33:24 (id: 1005033024)

24I say this about the tribe of Asher: Yahweh will bless the descendants of Asher more than he will bless the other tribes. Yahweh will favor them most of all. I desire that their land will be filled with olive trees that will produce a lot of olives to make olive oil.


## Deuteronomy 33:25 (id: 1005033025)

25Their towns will be protected by high walls with gates that have bronze and iron bars; I desire all the time that they live and not be harmed by anyone.


## Deuteronomy 33:26 (id: 1005033026)

26You people of Israel, there is no god like your God, who rides majestically across the sky to help you.


## Deuteronomy 33:27 (id: 1005033027)

27God, who lives forever, is the one who gives you refuge; it is as though he puts his everlasting arms under you to support you. He will drive out your enemies while you advance; he has told you to destroy all of them.


## Deuteronomy 33:28 (id: 1005033028)

28So you Israelite people will live safely; you descendants of Jacob will not be disturbed by others; in the land where you will live, there will be plenty of grain and wine, and plenty of rain will fall from the sky.


## Deuteronomy 33:29 (id: 1005033029)

29You people of Israel, how fortunate are you. There is certainly no nation like your nation, whom Yahweh has rescued from being slaves in Egypt. He will be like a shield to protect you and like a sword to enable you to defeat your enemies. Your enemies will come to you begging for you to act mercifully toward them, but you will trample on their backs.”


## Deuteronomy 34:1 (id: 1005034001)

1Then Moses climbed up from the plains in the region of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the highest point on Mount Pisgah, which is across the Jordan River from Jericho. There Yahweh showed him all the land that the Israelites would occupy. He showed him the region of Gilead as far north as the city of Dan;


## Deuteronomy 34:2 (id: 1005034002)

2all the land that the tribe of Naphtali would occupy; all the land that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh had occupied; all the land that the tribe of Judah would occupy as far west as the Mediterranean Sea;


## Deuteronomy 34:3 (id: 1005034003)

3the desert area in the south part of Judah; and the Valley of the Jordan that extends from Jericho in the north to the city of Zoar in the south.


## Deuteronomy 34:4 (id: 1005034004)

4Then Yahweh said to him, “You have now seen this land that I solemnly promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have allowed you to see it from a distance, but you will not go there.”


## Deuteronomy 34:5 (id: 1005034005)

5So Moses, who always served Yahweh faithfully, died there in the land of in Moab, which is what Yahweh said would happen.


## Deuteronomy 34:6 (id: 1005034006)

6Yahweh buried Moses’ body in the valley in the land of Moab, across from the town of Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where he is buried.


## Deuteronomy 34:7 (id: 1005034007)

7Moses was 120 years old when he died, but he was still very strong, and he could still see very well.


## Deuteronomy 34:8 (id: 1005034008)

8The Israelite people mourned for him in the plains of Moab for thirty days.


## Deuteronomy 34:9 (id: 1005034009)

9God caused Joshua to be very wise, because Moses had put his hands on Joshua to appoint him to be their new leader. The Israelite people obeyed Joshua, and they obeyed all the commands that Yahweh had given to Moses to tell to the Israelite people.


## Deuteronomy 34:10 (id: 1005034010)

10Since the time that Moses lived, there has never been a prophet in Israel like him, for Yahweh spoke with him face to face.


## Deuteronomy 34:11 (id: 1005034011)

11No other prophet has performed all the kinds of powerful miracles that Yahweh caused him to do against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, against all his servants, and against the people of Egypt.


## Deuteronomy 34:12 (id: 1005034012)

12No other prophet has been able to perform all the great and terrifying deeds that Moses performed while all the Israelites watched.
