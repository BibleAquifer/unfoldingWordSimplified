43Moza was the father of Binea. Rephaiah was Binea’s son. Eleasah was Rephaiah’s son. Azel was Eleasah’s son.


## 1 Chronicles 9:44 (id: 1013009044)

44Azel had six sons. Their names were Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were all of Azel’s sons.


## 1 Chronicles 10:1 (id: 1013010001)

1Now, the Philistine army battled the Israelites. The Israelite soldiers ran away from them, and many Israelites died on Mount Gilboa.


## 1 Chronicles 10:2 (id: 1013010002)

2The Philistine soldiers caught up with Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki\-Shua.


## 1 Chronicles 10:3 (id: 1013010003)

3The fighting was very fierce around Saul. The archers shot Saul, and they wounded him severely.


## 1 Chronicles 10:4 (id: 1013010004)

4Saul said to his armor bearer, “Take out your sword and kill me with it, so that these heathen Philistines will not be able to torture me.” But his armor bearer refused to do that because he was very scared. So Saul grabbed his own sword and stabbed himself with it and died.


## 1 Chronicles 10:5 (id: 1013010005)

5When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also stabbed himself with his own sword and died.


## 1 Chronicles 10:6 (id: 1013010006)

6So Saul and his three sons died. So his whole dynasty ended together.


## 1 Chronicles 10:7 (id: 1013010007)

7When all the Israelites living in the valley saw that their army had run away and that Saul and his sons were dead, they left their towns and ran away. Then the Philistine soldiers came and occupied those towns.


## 1 Chronicles 10:8 (id: 1013010008)

8The next day, when the Philistine soldiers came to take away the possessions of the dead Israelite soldiers, they found Saul and his sons dead on Mount Gilboa.


## 1 Chronicles 10:9 (id: 1013010009)

9They took everything from Saul’s corpse; they cut off his head and took his equipment. Then they sent messengers throughout their own land, to proclaim the news to their idols and to their people.


## 1 Chronicles 10:10 (id: 1013010010)

10They put Saul’s equipment in the temple to their gods, and they hung his severed head in the temple to their god Dagon.


## 1 Chronicles 10:11 (id: 1013010011)

11Everyone who lived in Jabesh in the region of Gilead heard about everything the Philistines had done to Saul’s corpse.


## 1 Chronicles 10:12 (id: 1013010012)

12So all the brave men of Jabesh went and got the corpses of Saul and his sons and brought them back to Jabesh. They buried their bodies under the big tree in Jabesh. Then the people of Jabesh fasted for seven days.


## 1 Chronicles 10:13 (id: 1013010013)

13Now, Saul died because of his treachery; he betrayed Yahweh by not doing what Yahweh said. Saul even went to a woman who talks to the spirits of dead people and asked her what he should do,


## 1 Chronicles 10:14 (id: 1013010014)

14instead of asking Yahweh what he should do. So Yahweh caused him to die and appointed David son of Jesse, to be the king of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 11:1 (id: 1013011001)

1Then the people of Israel came to David at the city of Hebron and said to him, “Listen, we have the same ancestors as you.


## 1 Chronicles 11:2 (id: 1013011002)

2In the past, when Saul was our king, you were the one who led our Israelite soldiers in battle. You are the one to whom Yahweh our God promised, ‘You will care for my people; you will lead Israel.’”


## 1 Chronicles 11:3 (id: 1013011003)

3So all the Israelite elders came to David at Hebron. There David made an agreement with them with Yahweh as witness. The elders anointed David with oil to set him apart to be the king of the Israelite people, just as Yahweh had previously told the prophet Samuel would happen.


## 1 Chronicles 11:4 (id: 1013011004)

4David and all the Israelite soldiers went to Jerusalem. Another name for the city was Jebus because the Jebus people group lived in the area.


## 1 Chronicles 11:5 (id: 1013011005)

5The people in the city said to David, “You will not get in here!” But David and his soldiers captured the fortress there named Zion. Another name for it since then is the City of David.


## 1 Chronicles 11:6 (id: 1013011006)

6Now, David had said to his soldiers, “Whoever leads our soldiers to defeat the people in Jebus will become the commander of all my army.” Joab son of Zeruiah led the soldiers, so he became the commander.


## 1 Chronicles 11:7 (id: 1013011007)

7So David moved into the fortress. That is why they named it the City of David.


## 1 Chronicles 11:8 (id: 1013011008)

8David’s workers rebuilt the city, starting where the land was filled in and extending to the wall that was around the city. Joab’s men repaired the other parts of the city.


## 1 Chronicles 11:9 (id: 1013011009)

9David became more and more powerful because Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, helped him.


## 1 Chronicles 11:10 (id: 1013011010)

10Together with all Israel, the leaders of David’s warriors helped establish David’s reign and supported him in becoming king, just as Yahweh had told Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 11:11 (id: 1013011011)

11David’s warriors included: Jashobeam was from the Hachmon clan. He was the leader of the officers. One time he fought against 300 enemies and killed them all with his spear.


## 1 Chronicles 11:12 (id: 1013011012)

12Next was Eleazar son of Dodo, from the clan of Ahoh. He was one of David’s three elite warriors.


## 1 Chronicles 11:13 (id: 1013011013)

13Once he was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistine soldiers gathered for the battle. There was a field of barley there. At first the Israelite soldiers ran away from the Philistine soldiers,


## 1 Chronicles 11:14 (id: 1013011014)

14but then they stopped in the middle of the field and fought to defend it. They killed the Philistine soldiers. Yahweh enabled them to win a great victory.


## 1 Chronicles 11:15 (id: 1013011015)

15One time three of David’s 30 greatest warriors came to David when he was camping next to the huge rock outside the cave near Adullam. At that same time, the Philistine army had camped in the Valley of Rephaim.


## 1 Chronicles 11:16 (id: 1013011016)

16David was then in a fortress, and some of the Philistine soldiers were occupying Bethlehem.


## 1 Chronicles 11:17 (id: 1013011017)

17One day David longingly said, “I wish that someone would bring me some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem.”


## 1 Chronicles 11:18 (id: 1013011018)

18So the three greatest warriors forced their way through the Philistine camp and drew some water from that well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out on the ground as an offering to Yahweh.


## 1 Chronicles 11:19 (id: 1013011019)

19He said, “God would consider it wrong for me to drink this water! That would be like drinking the blood of these men and taking their lives, since they were willing to give their lives for me!” So he refused to drink it. That was one of the things that David’s three greatest warriors did.


## 1 Chronicles 11:20 (id: 1013011020)

20Now Joab’s brother Abshai was the leader of the three elite warriors, and he gained fame among those three. One time Abshai fought 300 enemies with his spear, and he killed them all.


## 1 Chronicles 11:21 (id: 1013011021)

21Among a second group of three elite warriors, he was honored and became their leader, but he was not considered part of the first group of three elite warriors.


## 1 Chronicles 11:22 (id: 1013011022)

22Jehoiada’s son Benaiah was a brave soldier from the city of Kabzeel who did great deeds. He killed two of the best warriors from the Moab people group. One day he went down into a pit in snowy weather and killed a lion.


## 1 Chronicles 11:23 (id: 1013011023)

23He also killed an Egyptian soldier who was two and one\-third meters tall. The Egyptian carried a spear that was as long as a weaver’s rod, but Benaiah fought him with a club. Benaiah grabbed the Egyptian’s spear and killed him with it.


## 1 Chronicles 11:24 (id: 1013011024)

24Those are some of the things that Benaiah son of Jehoiada did. So he became famous along with the three elite warriors.


## 1 Chronicles 11:25 (id: 1013011025)

25Indeed, he was more honored than the remainder of the 30 warriors, but he did not become a member of the first group of three warriors. David appointed him to be the leader of his bodyguards.


## 1 Chronicles 11:26 (id: 1013011026)

8Some men from the tribe of Gad east of the Jordan River joined David when he was at his garrison in the caves in the desert. They were brave warriors who were trained for fighting battles and able to use shields and spears well. They were as fierce as lions, and they could run as fast as deer on the hills.


## 1 Chronicles 12:9 (id: 1013012009)

15They crossed to the west side of the Jordan River during a certain month in spring, at the time of the year when the river floods. They chased from there all the people who lived in the valleys on both sides of the river.


## 1 Chronicles 12:16 (id: 1013012016)

16Some other men from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah also came to David in his garrison.


## 1 Chronicles 12:17 (id: 1013012017)

17David went out of the cave to meet them and said to them, “If you have come peacefully to help me, I am eager to have you join with me. But if you have come to enable my enemies to capture me, even though I have not done anything to harm you, I hope that the God whom our ancestors worshiped will see it and condemn you.”


## 1 Chronicles 12:18 (id: 1013012018)

18Then God’s Spirit came on Amasai, who was the leader of the thirty greatest warriors, and Amasai said, “David, we want to be with you; you who are the son of Jesse, we will join you.

## 1 Chronicles 12:19 (id: 1013012019)

19Some men from the tribe of Manasseh also joined David when he went with the soldiers of Philistia to fight against Saul’s army.

The leaders of Philistia said, “If David joins his master Saul again, we will all be killed.”


## 1 Chronicles 12:20 (id: 1013012020)

20When David went to Ziklag, these were the men from the tribe of Manasseh who went with him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, another man whose name was Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each of them had been a commander of one thousand men from the tribe of Manasseh in Saul’s army.


## 1 Chronicles 12:21 (id: 1013012021)

21They helped David to fight against the groups of men who roamed throughout the country robbing people because these men from the tribe of Manasseh were all brave soldiers and became commanders in David’s army.


## 1 Chronicles 12:22 (id: 1013012022)

22Every day more men joined David’s men to support David, and his army became large, like the army of God.


## 1 Chronicles 12:23 (id: 1013012023)

23These are the numbers of soldiers who were ready for battle who joined David at the city of Hebron. They came to help him to become the king of Israel instead of Saul, as Yahweh had promised would happen.

## 1 Chronicles 12:37 (id: 1013012037)

37There were also 120,000 soldiers from the area east of the Jordan River who joined David. They were from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh. They had all kinds of weapons for battle.


## 1 Chronicles 12:38 (id: 1013012038)

38All those men were soldiers who joined the ranks of David’s army. They came to Hebron wanting very much to enable David to be the king of all of the Israelite people. The remainer of the Israelite people were also united in wanting to make David their king.


## 1 Chronicles 12:39 (id: 1013012039)

39The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, because their families gave them food to take with them.


## 1 Chronicles 12:40 (id: 1013012040)

40Also, their fellow Israelites came from as far away as the area where the tribes of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali lived, bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. They brought a lot of various types of food: flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle and sheep. They brought so much because the people throughout Israel were very joyful.


## 1 Chronicles 13:1 (id: 1013013001)

1One day David talked with all his army officers. Some of them were commanders of 100 soldiers and some were commanders of 1, 000 soldiers.


## 1 Chronicles 13:2 (id: 1013013002)

2Then David summoned the other Israelite leaders and said to all of them, “If you think it is a good idea, and if it is what Yahweh our God wants, let us send a message to our fellow Israelites throughout our country, including the priests and descendants of Levi who are living among them in their towns and in the nearby pasturelands, to come and join us.


## 1 Chronicles 13:3 (id: 1013013003)

3Let us bring the sacred chest of our God back to us since we did not ask God what he wanted us to do while Saul was the king.”


## 1 Chronicles 13:4 (id: 1013013004)

4All the people agreed with David to send the messages and bring back the sacred chest because they all thought that it was the right thing to do.


## 1 Chronicles 13:5 (id: 1013013005)

5So David gathered all the Israelite people, from the Shihor River in Egypt to the city of Lebo Hamath in the north, and told them that he wanted them to help bring the sacred chest of God back to Jerusalem from the city of Kiriath Jearim.


## 1 Chronicles 13:6 (id: 1013013006)

6David went with all the Israelite people to the city of Baalah, which is another name for Kiriath Jearim, to get from that city the sacred chest of God, Yahweh. (Baalah was located in the land belonging to the tribe of Judah). The people believed that God sat like a king on a throne between the statues of winged creatures that was above the lid of the sacred chest. The sacred chest belonged to Yahweh.


## 1 Chronicles 13:7 (id: 1013013007)

7The people put the sacred chest of God on a new cart and took it from Abinadab’s house. Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the oxen that were pulling the cart.


## 1 Chronicles 13:8 (id: 1013013008)

8David and all the Israelite people celebrated with all their strength all around the cart carrying the sacred chest. They were singing, playing lyres, harps, tambourines, and cymbals, and blowing trumpets.


## 1 Chronicles 13:9 (id: 1013013009)

9However, when the people and the cart came to the place where Kidon threshed grain, the oxen stumbled. So Uzzah reached out with his hand to prevent the sacred chest from falling off the cart.


## 1 Chronicles 13:10 (id: 1013013010)

10Yahweh became very angry with Uzzah, and he killed Uzzah because Uzzah had put his hand on the sacred chest. Yahweh had commanded during the time of Moses that no one touch the sacred chest. Uzzah died there in front of the sacred chest.


## 1 Chronicles 13:11 (id: 1013013011)

11David was angry because Yahweh inflicted punishment on Uzzah. David called that place where Uzzah died “The Punishment of Uzzah” (which has continued to be its nickname until the writing of this document).


## 1 Chronicles 13:12 (id: 1013013012)

12That day, David was afraid of God. He thought to himself, “{Since God is angry with me,} I cannot bring God’s sacred chest to my city.”


## 1 Chronicles 13:13 (id: 1013013013)

13So David and the people did not take the sacred chest to the portion of Jerusalem named the City of David. Instead, they took it to Obed Edom’s house, who was from the city of Gath.


## 1 Chronicles 13:14 (id: 1013013014)

14The sacred chest of God stayed with Obed Edom’s family in his house for three months. During that time Yahweh blessed Obed Edom’s family and everything that Obed Edom owned.


## 1 Chronicles 14:1 (id: 1013014001)

1One day Hiram, the king of the city of Tyre, sent some messengers to David to talk about making an agreement between their countries. Then Hiram sent cedar logs, bricklayers, and carpenters to build a palace for David.


## 1 Chronicles 14:2 (id: 1013014002)

2When that happened, David knew that Yahweh had truly caused him to be the king of Israel, and that Yahweh had caused the surrounding nations to respect David’s kingdom. Yahweh did this because he loved his Israelite people.


## 1 Chronicles 14:3 (id: 1013014003)

3David married more women in Jerusalem, and those women gave birth to more sons and daughters for him.


## 1 Chronicles 14:4 (id: 1013014004)

4The names of the children who were born to him in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,


## 1 Chronicles 14:5 (id: 1013014005)

## 1 Chronicles 14:7 (id: 1013014007)

7Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.


## 1 Chronicles 14:8 (id: 1013014008)

8When the army of Philistia heard that people in Israel appointed David to be king of all of Israel, they went to try to capture him. But David heard that the army of Philistia was coming, so he and his soldiers went out to fight against them.


## 1 Chronicles 14:9 (id: 1013014009)

9Now, the army of Philistia had come to the Valley of Rephaim southwest of Jerusalem and had attacked and robbed the people there.


## 1 Chronicles 14:10 (id: 1013014010)

10So David asked God, “Should my men and I go and attack the army of Philistia? If we go, will you enable us to defeat them?” Yahweh replied, “Yes, go, and I will enable you to defeat them.”


## 1 Chronicles 14:11 (id: 1013014011)

11The soldiers of Philistia went to a town people now call “Baal Perazim.” David and his men met the soldiers of Philistia there and defeated them. Then David said, “God has completely defeated my enemies by using me and my army. God destroyed them like water breaking a dam.” So they named that place “Baal Perazim,” which meant “The Lord breaks through.”


## 1 Chronicles 14:12 (id: 1013014012)

12As the soldiers of Philistia fled, they left their idols there. So David commanded his soldiers to burn those idols.


## 1 Chronicles 14:13 (id: 1013014013)

13But soon the army of Philistia attacked the people in that valley again.


## 1 Chronicles 14:14 (id: 1013014014)

14So again David prayed to God to ask him what he should do, and God replied, “Do not attack the army of Philistia from the front. Instead, go around them, and attack them from the rear in front of the balsam trees.


## 1 Chronicles 14:15 (id: 1013014015)

15When you hear something in the tops of the balsam trees that sounds like soldiers marching, that is when you must attack, because I, God, will have gone ahead of you to enable you to defeat the army of Philistia.”


## 1 Chronicles 14:16 (id: 1013014016)

16So David did what God commanded him to do, and he and his army defeated the army of Philistia, all the way from the city of Gibeon west to the city of Gezer.


## 1 Chronicles 14:17 (id: 1013014017)

17So David became famous in all the nearby countries, and Yahweh caused the leaders of all the nations to be afraid of him.


## 1 Chronicles 15:1 (id: 1013015001)

1David commanded his workers to build houses for himself in the section of Jerusalem named the City of David. He also told them to set up a place in which to put the sacred chest of God. They put up a large tent for the sacred chest.


## 1 Chronicles 15:2 (id: 1013015002)

2Then David said, “No one but the descendants of Levi may carry God’s sacred chest, because Yahweh chose them to carry it and to serve him forever.”


## 1 Chronicles 15:3 (id: 1013015003)

3David summoned all the people of Israel to come to Jerusalem. He wanted a celebration when the Levites brought the sacred chest of Yahweh to the place his workers set up for it.


## 1 Chronicles 15:4 (id: 1013015004)

4David summoned the descendants of Aaron, who was the first high priest, and the other descendants of Levi:


## 1 Chronicles 15:5 (id: 1013015005)

5from the descendants of Kohath, Levi’s second son, Uriel the leader and his relatives, 120 in all;


## 1 Chronicles 15:6 (id: 1013015006)

6from the descendants of Merari, Levi’s third son, Asaiah the leader and his relatives, 220 in all;


## 1 Chronicles 15:7 (id: 1013015007)

7from the descendants of Gershon, Levi’s first son, Joel the leader and his relatives, 130 in all;


## 1 Chronicles 15:8 (id: 1013015008)

8from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the leader and his relatives, 200 in all;


## 1 Chronicles 15:9 (id: 1013015009)

9from the descendants of Hebron, Eliel the leader and his relatives, 80 in all;


## 1 Chronicles 15:10 (id: 1013015010)

10from the descendants of Uzziel, Amminadab the leader and his relatives, 112 in all.


## 1 Chronicles 15:11 (id: 1013015011)

11David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and these descendants of Levi: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.


## 1 Chronicles 15:12 (id: 1013015012)

12David said to them, “You are the leaders of the clans descended from Levi. You and your family members must ceremonially purify yourselves, in order to be able to do this special work for Yahweh. You must bring the sacred chest of Yahweh, the God of us Israelites, to the place that I set up for it here in Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 15:13 (id: 1013015013)

13The first time that we tried to bring it, you descendants of Levi were not the ones who carried it, since we did not follow Yahweh’s command in the law of Moses regarding carrying the sacred chest. So Yahweh our God punished us.”


## 1 Chronicles 15:14 (id: 1013015014)

14Then the priests and the descendants of Levi performed the rituals to purify themselves, in order that it would be proper for them to carry the sacred chest of Yahweh, the God of the Israelite people.


## 1 Chronicles 15:15 (id: 1013015015)

15Just as the law of Moses said, according to the command of Yahweh, the descendants of Levi fastened poles to God’s sacred chest and carried it by putting the poles on their shoulders.


## 1 Chronicles 15:16 (id: 1013015016)

16David told the leaders of the descendants of Levi to appoint some of their relatives to sing and play lyres, harps, and cymbals, making joyful music while they were carrying the sacred chest.


## 1 Chronicles 15:17 (id: 1013015017)

17So they appointed Heman and his relatives Asaph and Ethan. Heman was the son of Joel. Asaph was the son of Berechiah. Ethan was the son of Kushaiah and was a descendant of Merari.


## 1 Chronicles 15:18 (id: 1013015018)

18They also appointed another group of relatives from the descendants of Levi: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and two of the temple gatekeepers, Obed Edom and Jeiel.


## 1 Chronicles 15:19 (id: 1013015019)

19Heman, Asaph and Ethan sang and also played bronze cymbals.


## 1 Chronicles 15:20 (id: 1013015020)

20Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played harps according to a certain musical style.


## 1 Chronicles 15:21 (id: 1013015021)

21Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah played lyres according to a different musical style.


## 1 Chronicles 15:22 (id: 1013015022)

22Kenaniah, the leader of the descendants of Levi in music, directed the singing because he was very capable.


## 1 Chronicles 15:23 (id: 1013015023)

23Berechiah and Elkanah were two of the men who guarded the sacred chest.


## 1 Chronicles 15:24 (id: 1013015024)

24The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer were the ones who blew trumpets in front of God’s sacred chest. Obed Edom and Jehiah also guarded the sacred chest.


## 1 Chronicles 15:25 (id: 1013015025)

25So David, the Israelite leaders, and the officers who commanded one thousand soldiers went to get the sacred chest symbolizing the agreement between Yahweh and the people of Israel. They joyfully got the sacred chest from Obed Edom’s house.


## 1 Chronicles 15:26 (id: 1013015026)

26Indeed, God helped the descendants of Levi who carried the sacred chest symbolizing the agreement between Yahweh and the people of Israel. Therefore David and the leaders sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams to thank him.


## 1 Chronicles 15:27 (id: 1013015027)

27David, all the descendants of Levi who carried the sacred chest, all the singers, and Kenaniah, the man who directed those who sang, wore robes of fine linen. David also wore a waistcloth made of linen.


## 1 Chronicles 15:28 (id: 1013015028)

28So all of the Israelite people joined in bringing up to Jerusalem the sacred chest symbolizing the agreement between Yahweh and the people of Israel. They shouted joyfully, blew horns and trumpets, and played cymbals, lyres, and harps.


## 1 Chronicles 15:29 (id: 1013015029)

29While they were bringing the sacred chest symbolizing the agreement between Yahweh and the people of Israel to the section of Jerusalem named the city of David, Michal (the first of David’s wives and Saul’s daughter) watched them, looking out of a window. When she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him.


## 1 Chronicles 16:1 (id: 1013016001)

1They brought God’s sacred chest to Jerusalem and put it inside the special tent that David’s workers set up. Then they brought offerings which they fully burned on the altar and other offerings commemorating friendship between them and God. They offered the offerings in front of the special tent which housed the sacred chest.


## 1 Chronicles 16:2 (id: 1013016002)

2When the priests finished presenting all those offerings, David asked Yahweh to bless the Israelite people.


## 1 Chronicles 16:3 (id: 1013016003)

3David ordered his servants to give a loaf of bread, a baked good with dates, and a baked good with raisins to every Israelite who was there, both men and women.


## 1 Chronicles 16:4 (id: 1013016004)

4Then David appointed some of the descendants of Levi to stand in front of the special tent in which the descendants of Levi placed Yahweh’s sacred chest, to lead the people who worshiped and thanked and praised Yahweh, the God of the Israelite people.


## 1 Chronicles 16:5 (id: 1013016005)

5Asaph was their leader. Zechariah was his assistant. The other descendants of Levi who helped were Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed\-Edom, and Jeiel. They played harps and lyres, and Asaph played cymbals.


## 1 Chronicles 16:6 (id: 1013016006)

6Benaiah and Jahaziel were priests who blew trumpets frequently in front of the special tent in which the descendants of Levi placed the sacred chest symbolizing the agreement between God and the people of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 16:7 (id: 1013016007)

7On that day, David first gave to Asaph and his helpers this song to praise Yahweh:


## 1 Chronicles 16:8 (id: 1013016008)

8Thank Yahweh and pray to him. Tell the people of all nations what he has done.


## 1 Chronicles 16:9 (id: 1013016009)

9Sing to him; sing songs to praise him. Tell about all his miraculous deeds.


## 1 Chronicles 16:10 (id: 1013016010)

10Be glad that he is holy. Those who follow Yahweh should rejoice.


## 1 Chronicles 16:11 (id: 1013016011)

11Ask Yahweh to help you and give you his strength. Frequently pray to him!


## 1 Chronicles 16:12 (id: 1013016012)

12Think about the wonderful things that he has done, the miracles he has done, and the just laws that he has decreed.


## 1 Chronicles 16:13 (id: 1013016013)

13We are the offsrping of his servant Israel; we are the descendants of Jacob whom he has chosen.


## 1 Chronicles 16:14 (id: 1013016014)

14Yahweh is our God. People throughout the world know his just laws.


## 1 Chronicles 16:15 (id: 1013016015)

15Think about for all of your life the agreement that he made; he made a promise that will last for 1,000 generations.


## 1 Chronicles 16:16 (id: 1013016016)

16That is the agreement that he made with Abraham, and God repeated that promise to Isaac, Abraham’s son.


## 1 Chronicles 16:17 (id: 1013016017)

17God continued the agreement for Isaac’s son, Jacob, as a decree; as a promise to Israel and his descendants for all time.


## 1 Chronicles 16:18 (id: 1013016018)

18God said, “I will give the region of Canaan to you, to belong to you and your descendants.”


## 1 Chronicles 16:19 (id: 1013016019)

19When there were hardly any of your ancestors, just a tiny group of people who were living in that land like strangers,


## 1 Chronicles 16:20 (id: 1013016020)

20they continued to wander from one place to another, from one kingdom to another.


## 1 Chronicles 16:21 (id: 1013016021)

21God did not allow others to oppress them, and he warned kings on your ancestors’ behalf by saying to them,


## 1 Chronicles 16:22 (id: 1013016022)

22“Do not harm the people whom I have chosen! Do not wrong my prophets!”


## 1 Chronicles 16:23 (id: 1013016023)

23You people throughout the world, sing to Yahweh. Every day proclaim to others that he has saved us.


## 1 Chronicles 16:24 (id: 1013016024)

24Tell among the nations that he is great; tell all the people groups the marvelous things that he has done;


## 1 Chronicles 16:25 (id: 1013016025)

25because Yahweh is great, and he deserves praise very much. Everyone should revere him more than all the gods,


## 1 Chronicles 16:26 (id: 1013016026)

26because all the gods that the other people groups worship are idols with no value, but Yahweh is truly great; he created the skies.


## 1 Chronicles 16:27 (id: 1013016027)

27Magnificence and grandeur come from where he is. Power and joy come from the place where he lives.


## 1 Chronicles 16:28 (id: 1013016028)

28You people in nations all over the world, praise Yahweh! Praise Yahweh for his glorious power!


## 1 Chronicles 16:29 (id: 1013016029)

29Attribute to Yahweh the glory his name deserves. Come to his place of worship with offerings to give to him! Bow down and worship Yahweh because he is holy and his holiness shines out from him with wonderful beauty.


## 1 Chronicles 16:30 (id: 1013016030)

30You people throughout the world, be reverent and respectful when you are in his place of worship because of his sheer power. As one example, he put the earth firmly in its place; nothing ever will be able to move it.


## 1 Chronicles 16:31 (id: 1013016031)

31Everything in the sky should celebrate and everything on the earth should cheer. Everything in the sky and on the earth declare to all the people groups of the world, “Yahweh is king!”


## 1 Chronicles 16:32 (id: 1013016032)

32The oceans and all the creatures in the oceans should shout; the fields and everything in them should rejoice.


## 1 Chronicles 16:33 (id: 1013016033)

33When that happens, the trees in the forest should cheer in front of Yahweh, because he will come to judge everyone on the earth.


## 1 Chronicles 16:34 (id: 1013016034)

34Thank Yahweh, because everything he does shows he is good, because he faithfully loves us always.


## 1 Chronicles 16:35 (id: 1013016035)

35Say to him, “God who provides our liberation, rescue us, and bring us together and save us from the armies of other nations, so that we will thank you for your sacred character and reputation, and revel in giving you praise.”


## 1 Chronicles 16:36 (id: 1013016036)

36Yahweh, the God of us Israelite people, deserves praise, for all time, in the past and in the future. After the people finished singing that song, they all said “We agree!”, and they praised Yahweh.


## 1 Chronicles 16:37 (id: 1013016037)

37Then David left Asaph and the other members of his clan there in front of the tent where the sacred chest symbolizing the agreement between Yahweh and the people of Israel was. David told them that they must do their work there every day.


## 1 Chronicles 16:38 (id: 1013016038)

38David also left Obed Edom and other descendants of Levi to work there, 68 in all. Hosah and Obed Edom, Jeduthun’s son, guarded the entrances of the sacred tent.


## 1 Chronicles 16:39 (id: 1013016039)

39David also told Zadok the high priest and the other priests who worked with him to remain in front of Yahweh’s sacred tent, at the place where the Israelite people worshiped Yahweh there in the city of Gibeon.


## 1 Chronicles 16:40 (id: 1013016040)

40Every morning and every evening they burned offerings to Yahweh on the altar for such offerings, obeying the rules Moses wrote down, the rules that Yahweh gave to the Israelite people.


## 1 Chronicles 16:41 (id: 1013016041)

41With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the other descendants of Levi whom David chose specifically. They sang songs to praise Yahweh because he faithfully loves his people forever.


## 1 Chronicles 16:42 (id: 1013016042)

42Heman and Jeduthun led the music, including those playing trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments for singing to God. Jeduthun’s sons guarded the gates of the sacred tent.


## 1 Chronicles 16:43 (id: 1013016043)

43Then all the people left. They all returned to their homes, and David returned home to ask Yahweh to bless his family.


## 1 Chronicles 17:1 (id: 1013017001)

1After David began to live in his palace, he said to the prophet Nathan, “It does not seem right that I am living in a palace made of cedar wood, but the sacred chest symbolizing the agreement between Yahweh and the people of Israel stays inside a tent!”


## 1 Chronicles 17:2 (id: 1013017002)

2Nathan replied to David, “Everything you are thinking about doing, do it, because God is with you.”


## 1 Chronicles 17:3 (id: 1013017003)

3But that night God spoke to Nathan. He said,


## 1 Chronicles 17:4 (id: 1013017004)

4“Go and tell my servant David this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to him: ‘You will not build a temple for me to live in,


## 1 Chronicles 17:5 (id: 1013017005)

5since I have not lived in any building from the day that I brought the people of Israel up out of Egypt until now. Rather, I have lived in my sacred tent, moving from one place to another when the Israelites moved around.


## 1 Chronicles 17:6 (id: 1013017006)

6Wherever I went with all the Israelites as they traveled, I never said to any of their leaders whom I appointed to lead them, “Why have you not built me a temple made of cedar wood?”


## 1 Chronicles 17:7 (id: 1013017007)

7Therefore, this is what you should say to my servant David: “Yahweh, the commander of the angel armies, says, ‘I took you from a pasture where you were taking care of sheep, and I appointed you to be the ruler of Israel, my people.


## 1 Chronicles 17:8 (id: 1013017008)

8I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have removed all your enemies who opposed you. Now, I will cause you to become very famous, as well known as the names of the greatest men who have ever lived on the earth.


## 1 Chronicles 17:9 (id: 1013017009)

9(9\-10\) Formerly, during the time that I appointed leaders for my Israelite people, many violent groups oppressed them. But this will not happen anymore. I have chosen a place where my Israelite people can live peacefully and no one will disturb them anymore. I will give them rest from being attacked by their enemies. And I will defeat all your enemies. I declare to you that I, Yahweh, will enable your descendants to rule after you die.


## 1 Chronicles 17:11 (id: 1013017011)

11When your life ends and you die and go to be with your ancestors who have died, I will appoint one of your descendants, one of your sons, to become king, and I will enable his kingdom to be strong.


## 1 Chronicles 17:12 (id: 1013017012)

12He is the one who will lead the building of a temple for me. And I will make his ruling dynasty last forever.


## 1 Chronicles 17:13 (id: 1013017013)

13I will be like a father to him, and he will be like a son to me. I stopped giving faithful love to Saul, the one who was the king before you became king, but I will never stop giving faithful love to your son.


## 1 Chronicles 17:14 (id: 1013017014)

14I will cause him and his descendants to rule over my people and my kingdom forever. His ruling dynasty will last forever.’”


## 1 Chronicles 17:15 (id: 1013017015)

15So Nathan reported to David everything that Yahweh had revealed to him.


## 1 Chronicles 17:16 (id: 1013017016)

16Then King David went into the tent housing the sacred chest, sat in the presence of Yahweh, and prayed this prayer: “Yahweh my God, I am certainly not worthy for you to have done of all these things for me, and my family is not worthy, either.


## 1 Chronicles 17:17 (id: 1013017017)

17And O God, now, in addition to everything else, you have spoken about what will happen to my descendants in the future for many generations. Yahweh my God, you have acted toward me as though I was the most important man on the earth!


## 1 Chronicles 17:18 (id: 1013017018)

18I, David, cannot say anything more to you in exchange for you honoring me. Yahweh, you know what kind of person I am.


## 1 Chronicles 17:19 (id: 1013017019)

19Yahweh, you have done these great things for my sake, according to the way you wanted, and in order to reveal all of these great things.


## 1 Chronicles 17:20 (id: 1013017020)

20Yahweh, there is no one like you. You are the only true God. This is what we have always heard.


## 1 Chronicles 17:21 (id: 1013017021)

21And there is no nation like Israel because Israel is the only nation on the earth whose people you went out to rescue to make them your people, to perform miracles and show how great and awesome you are, and to expel the people of other people groups in Canaan who were before your people, the Israelites, whom you rescued from being slaves in Egypt.


## 1 Chronicles 17:22 (id: 1013017022)

22You caused us your Israelite people to belong to you as your people forever, and you, Yahweh, became our God!


## 1 Chronicles 17:23 (id: 1013017023)

23And now Yahweh, I pray that you will cause the things that you have promised about me and my descendants to be fulfilled forever, and do the things that you have said that you would do.


## 1 Chronicles 17:24 (id: 1013017024)

24I pray that those things will happen so people will celebrate your excellent reputation forever. People will exclaim, ‘Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, is the God of Israel. He is the God who rules Israel!’ You will cause my descendants to be the king of the people you rule,


## 1 Chronicles 17:25 (id: 1013017025)

25because you, my God, have revealed to me that you will cause me to have a ruling dynasty. So I am brave enough to pray like this to you.


## 1 Chronicles 17:26 (id: 1013017026)

26Now, Yahweh, you are God! You have promised to do these good things for me.


## 1 Chronicles 17:27 (id: 1013017027)

27And now you have promised to bless my descendants, in order that they will forever be king over the people you rule. Indeed, you, Yahweh, have given your blessing, and you will keep blessing them forever.”


## 1 Chronicles 18:1 (id: 1013018001)

1Some time later, David’s army attacked and defeated the army of Philistia, subduing them. They captured the Philistine city of Gath and its surrounding villages.


## 1 Chronicles 18:2 (id: 1013018002)

2His army also defeated the army of the Moab people group, so the Moab people group had to accept David as their ruler. They had to pay money each year to David’s government, in order that David’s army would protect them.


## 1 Chronicles 18:3 (id: 1013018003)

3David’s army also fought and defeated the army of Hadadezer, the king of the region of Zobah in Aram near the city of Hamath, when Hadadezer was trying to establish control over the area near the Euphrates River.


## 1 Chronicles 18:4 (id: 1013018004)

4David’s army captured 1,000 of Hadadezer’s chariots, 7,000 chariot drivers, and 20,000 infantry soldiers. David’s army hamstrung most of Hadadezer’s horses; there were only 100 horses that they did not cripple.


## 1 Chronicles 18:5 (id: 1013018005)

5When the army of Aram came from the city of Damascus to fight alongside Hadadezer’s army, David’s army killed 22,000 soliders from the army of Aram.


## 1 Chronicles 18:6 (id: 1013018006)

6Then David stationed groups of his soldiers in Damascus. So the people of Aram had to accept David as their ruler. They had to pay money each year to David’s government, in order that David’s army would protect them. Yahweh enabled David’s army to win battles everywhere they went.


## 1 Chronicles 18:7 (id: 1013018007)

7David’s soldiers took the gold shields that Hadadezer’s soldiers carried and brought them to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 18:8 (id: 1013018008)

8They also brought from Tebah and Kun, two cities that belonged to Hadadezer, a lot of bronze, which David’s son Solomon later used to make the huge bronze basin called “The Sea” and the pillars and other bronze items for the temple.


## 1 Chronicles 18:9 (id: 1013018009)

9When Tou, the king of the city of Hamath in Aram, heard that David’s army had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah in Aram,


## 1 Chronicles 18:10 (id: 1013018010)

10he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to greet him and congratulate him about his fighting and defeating Hadadezer’s army because Tou’s army had been fighting Hadadezer’s. Hadoram brought to David many items made of gold, silver, and bronze,


## 1 Chronicles 18:11 (id: 1013018011)

11and King David dedicated those things to Yahweh, like he had done with the silver and gold that his soldiers had taken from other nations: the Edom, Moab, and Ammon people groups, the people from Philistia, and from the descendants of Amalek.


## 1 Chronicles 18:12 (id: 1013018012)

12The army of David’s military commander Abishai, whose mother was Zeruiah, killed 18,000 soldiers from Edom in the Valley of Salt.


## 1 Chronicles 18:13 (id: 1013018013)

13Then David stationed groups of his soldiers there in Edom, and the people of Edom had to accept David as their ruler. Yahweh protected David and his army wherever they traveled.


## 1 Chronicles 18:14 (id: 1013018014)

14David ruled over all the Israelite people, and he always did for them what was just and fair.


## 1 Chronicles 18:15 (id: 1013018015)

15Joab son of Zeruiah was the chief army commander. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the record keeper.


## 1 Chronicles 18:16 (id: 1013018016)

16Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests. Shavsha was the official secretary.


## 1 Chronicles 18:17 (id: 1013018017)

17Benaiah son of Jehoiada led the Kereth and Peleth people groups who were David’s bodyguards. David’s sons were his most important officials.


## 1 Chronicles 19:1 (id: 1013019001)

1Some time later, Nahash, the king of the Ammon people group, died. Then his son Hanun became their king.


## 1 Chronicles 19:2 (id: 1013019002)

2When David heard about that, he thought to himself, “Nahash was kind to me, so I will be kind to his son.” So David sent some officials there to tell Hanun that David was sorry to hear that Hanun’s father had died. But when David’s officials came to Hanun in the land where the Ammonite people group lived to deliver the message,


## 1 Chronicles 19:3 (id: 1013019003)

3the leaders of the Ammon people group said to Hanun, “David is not really honoring your father’s memory by sending these men to give his condolences. We think that his men have come to look around our land in order to determine how his army can conquer us.”


## 1 Chronicles 19:4 (id: 1013019004)

4Hanun believed what the leaders said; so he commanded some soldiers to seize David’s officials. Hanun’s soldiers insulted the officials by shaving off their beards and cutting off the lower part of their robes. Then Hanun sent David’s officials away.


## 1 Chronicles 19:5 (id: 1013019005)

5The officials left and were greatly humiliated. When David found out about what had happened to his officials, he sent some messengers to them to tell them, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown again, and then return home.”


## 1 Chronicles 19:6 (id: 1013019006)

6Then the leaders of the Ammon people group realized that they had greatly insulted David. So Hanun and some of his officials sent 33,000 kilograms of silver to hire chariots and chariot drivers from the regions of Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah and Zobah northeast of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 19:7 (id: 1013019007)

7They hired 32,000 chariots and chariot drivers, as well as the king of the region of Maacah and his army. They came and set up their tents near the city of Medeba in the region of Moab. The soldiers from the Ammon people group also marched out from their cities and were ready for battle.


## 1 Chronicles 19:8 (id: 1013019008)

8When David heard about that, he sent Joab and all his army.


## 1 Chronicles 19:9 (id: 1013019009)

9The soldiers of the Ammon people group came out of their city and lined up for battle at the entrance of their city. Meanwhile, the other kings who had come with their armies stood in their positions in the open fields.


## 1 Chronicles 19:10 (id: 1013019010)

10Joab saw that there were groups of enemy soldiers in front of his troops and behind his troops. So he selected some of the best Israelite troops and put them in positions to fight against the soldiers of Aram.


## 1 Chronicles 19:11 (id: 1013019011)

11He appointed his older brother Abishai to be the commander of his other soldiers and he told them to stand in their positions in front of the army of the Ammon people group.


## 1 Chronicles 19:12 (id: 1013019012)

12Joab said to them, “If the soldiers from Aram are too strong for us to defeat them, then your soldiers must come and help us. But if the soldiers from the Ammon people group are too strong for you to defeat them, then my soldiers will come and help your men.


## 1 Chronicles 19:13 (id: 1013019013)

13We must be strong and fight hard to defend our people and our cities that belong to our God. Yahweh will do what he considers to be good.”


## 1 Chronicles 19:14 (id: 1013019014)

14So Joab and his troops advanced to fight the army of Aram; and the soldiers from Aram ran away from Joab and his soldiers.


## 1 Chronicles 19:15 (id: 1013019015)

15And when the soldiers of the Ammon people group saw that the soldiers from Aram were running away, they also started to run away from Abishai and his army, and they retreated back inside the city. So Joab and his army returned to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 19:16 (id: 1013019016)

16After the leaders of the army of Aram realized that the army of Israel had defeated them, the leaders of the army of Aram sent messengers to another part of Aram on the east side of the Euphrates river, and brought troops from there to the battle area, with Shophak, the commander of Hadadezer’s army, leading them.


## 1 Chronicles 19:17 (id: 1013019017)

17When David heard about that, he gathered all the Israelite soldiers, and they crossed the Jordan River. They advanced against the army of Aram and took their battle positions to attack them. With David’s army on the battle field ready to fight, the army of Aram attacked David’s army.


## 1 Chronicles 19:18 (id: 1013019018)

18But the army of Aram ran away from the soldiers of Israel. However, David’s soldiers killed 7,000 of their chariot drivers and 40,000 infantry soldiers. They also killed Shophak, their army commander.


## 1 Chronicles 19:19 (id: 1013019019)

19When the kings who had been subjects of Hadadezer realized that the Israelite army had defeated them, they made peace with David, and agreed to have him rule over them. So the rulers of Aram did not want to help the rulers of the Ammon people group anymore.


## 1 Chronicles 20:1 (id: 1013020001)

1In that region, kings usually went with their armies to fight their enemies in the springtime. But the following year, David did not do that. Instead, he stayed in Jerusalem and sent his commander Joab to lead the army. Joab and his troops ruined the land of the Ammon people group. Then they went to Rabbah, the capital city, and surrounded it. Joab and his troops killed the army in the city of Rabbah and demolished the city.


## 1 Chronicles 20:2 (id: 1013020002)

2David then came to Rabbah, took the crown from the head of the king of Rabbah and put it on his own head. It weighed thirty\-three kilograms and was gold. It had a valuable stone in it. They also took many other valuable things from the city.


## 1 Chronicles 20:3 (id: 1013020003)

3Then they brought the people out of the city and forced them to work for their army, using saws and iron picks and axes. David’s soldiers did this in all the cities of the Ammon people group. Then David and all of his army returned to Jerusalem.


## 1 Chronicles 20:4 (id: 1013020004)

4Some time later, David’s army fought with the army of Philistia, at the city of Gezer. During the battle Sibbekai, from the Hushah clan, killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rapha giants. So David’s army defeated the army of Philistia.


## 1 Chronicles 20:5 (id: 1013020005)

5In another battle against the soldiers of Philistia, Elhanan son of Jair, killed Lahmi, the younger brother of the giant Goliath from the city of Gath, who had a spear which was as thick as a weaver’s rod.


## 1 Chronicles 20:6 (id: 1013020006)

6There was another battle near Gath. A huge man was there who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. He was also a descendant of the Rapha giants.


## 1 Chronicles 20:7 (id: 1013020007)

7When he insulted the soldiers of Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea killed him. Shimea was one of David’s older brothers.


## 1 Chronicles 20:8 (id: 1013020008)

8Those were some of the descendants of the Rapha giants who had lived in Gath. David and his soldiers killed them.


## 1 Chronicles 21:1 (id: 1013021001)

1An opponent decided to cause the Israelite people to have trouble. So he provoked David to find out how many men in Israel were able to be in the army.


## 1 Chronicles 21:2 (id: 1013021002)

2So David commanded Joab and the other army commanders, “Go out and count all the men in Israel who are able to be in the army. Start at Beersheba in the south and go all the way to Dan in the north. Then come back and report to me, in order that I may know how many men there are.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:3 (id: 1013021003)

3But Joab replied, “Your Majesty, I hope that Yahweh will make our army a hundred times larger than it is now. But we all serve you. So you should not commit this sin, your Highness, and make Israel suffer for it.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:4 (id: 1013021004)

4But David would not change his mind. So Joab and his soldiers went everywhere in Israel and in Judah, and counted the people. Then they returned to Jerusalem,


## 1 Chronicles 21:5 (id: 1013021005)

5and they reported to David that there were 1,100,000 men in Israel who could be in the army, and 470,000 men in Judah who could be in the army.


## 1 Chronicles 21:6 (id: 1013021006)

6However, Joab did not count the men from the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he was disgusted with what the king had commanded.


## 1 Chronicles 21:7 (id: 1013021007)

7David’s command to count the people caused God to become angry, so he told David that he had decided to punish the people of Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 21:8 (id: 1013021008)

8Then David prayed to God, “What I did was very foolish. I committed a terrible sin by what I have done. So now I plead with you, please forgive me.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:9 (id: 1013021009)

9Then Yahweh said to Gad, David’s prophet,


## 1 Chronicles 21:10 (id: 1013021010)

10“Go and tell this to David: ‘Yahweh says, “I am allowing you to choose one of three things to punish you. I will do whichever one you choose.”’”


## 1 Chronicles 21:11 (id: 1013021011)

11So Gad went to David and said to him, “Yahweh says: ‘You can choose one of these punishments:


## 1 Chronicles 21:12 (id: 1013021012)

12either three years of famine in Israel, or three months during which your armies will run away from their enemies who will attack and overrun them with swords, or three days of direct punishment from me during which I will send my angel to cause many people in the country to die because of a plague.’ So you must decide what I will say to answer Yahweh, the one who sent me.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:13 (id: 1013021013)

13David replied to Gad, “I am very distressed. Allow Yahweh to punish me, because he is very merciful, and do not allow humans to punish me.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:14 (id: 1013021014)

14So Yahweh sent a plague on the people of Israel, and 70,000 Israelite people died because of the plague.


## 1 Chronicles 21:15 (id: 1013021015)

15And God sent an angel to kill the people in Jerusalem with the plague. While the angel was killing people, Yahweh saw all the suffering that the people had endured and decided to stop the killing. So he said to the angel when the angel was standing at the place where Ornan, from the Jebus people group, threshed grain, “Stop what you are doing! That is enough!”


## 1 Chronicles 21:16 (id: 1013021016)

16David looked up and saw the angel whom Yahweh had sent, standing between the sky and the ground. The angel had a sword in his hand that he pointed toward Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of the city, who were wearing clothes made of rough sackcloth, prostrated themselves on the ground.


## 1 Chronicles 21:17 (id: 1013021017)

17David prayed to God, “I am the one who ordered the census of the men who could be in the army. I am the one who has sinned and done what is wrong, but these people are as innocent as sheep. They have certainly not done anything that is wrong. So Yahweh my God, punish me and my family, but do not allow this plague to continue to cause your people to become sick and die.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:18 (id: 1013021018)

18Then the angel whom Yahweh had sent told Gad to tell David to go up to the place where Ornan threshed grain and build an altar to worship Yahweh there.


## 1 Chronicles 21:19 (id: 1013021019)

19So after Gad told David, he obeyed the message that Yahweh had given to Gad, and he went up there.


## 1 Chronicles 21:20 (id: 1013021020)

20While Ornan was threshing some wheat, he turned and saw the angel. His four sons who were with him also saw the angel, and they hid themselves.


## 1 Chronicles 21:21 (id: 1013021021)

21Then David approached the place where Ornan was. When Ornan saw him, Ornan left the place where he was threshing grain and prostrated himself in front of David, with his face touching the ground.


## 1 Chronicles 21:22 (id: 1013021022)

22David said to Ornan, “Sell me this threshing place so I can build an altar here to worship Yahweh, in order that he will stop this plague. I will pay the full price.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:23 (id: 1013021023)

23Ornan answered David, “Take it! Your Majesty, do whatever you want to. I will even give you the oxen that thresh the grain for a fully burnt offering on the altar, the threshing boards to use as wood on the altar, and the flour for a flour offering. I will provide everything.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:24 (id: 1013021024)

24But King David said to Ornan, “No, I must pay you the full price, because I will not take things that belong to you and offer them to Yahweh as a fully burnt offering when they cost me nothing.”


## 1 Chronicles 21:25 (id: 1013021025)

25So David paid Ornan six and one\-half kilograms of gold for the whole area.


## 1 Chronicles 21:26 (id: 1013021026)

26David built an altar to worship Yahweh there, and he offered on the altar fully burnt sacrifices and sacrifices to restore fellowship with Yahweh. David prayed to Yahweh, and Yahweh answered by sending a fire from heaven to burn up the offerings on the altar.


## 1 Chronicles 21:27 (id: 1013021027)

27Then Yahweh told the angel to put his sword back into its sheath. So the angel did that.


## 1 Chronicles 21:28 (id: 1013021028)

28And when David saw that Yahweh had answered him there at the place where Ornan threshed grain and had ended the plague, he offered sacrifices there.


## 1 Chronicles 21:29 (id: 1013021029)

29At that time, Yahweh’s sacred tent, which Moses had commanded others to build in the wilderness, and the altar for burning sacrifices completely, were on a hill used for worship near the city of Gibeon.


## 1 Chronicles 21:30 (id: 1013021030)

30But David did not want to go there to request God to tell him what he wanted David to do, because he was afraid that the angel sent from Yahweh might strike him with his sword.


## 1 Chronicles 22:1 (id: 1013022001)

1David realized that this was the place that Yahweh now wanted sacrifices to be made and announced, “Here, at the edge of Jerusalem, is where we will build the temple for our God Yahweh, and where we will make the altar for fully burning the offerings that the Israelite people will bring.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:2 (id: 1013022002)

2So David commanded that the foreigners who lived in Israel must assemble together. When they did that, he appointed some of those men to cut huge stones from the quarries and to smooth their surfaces for use in building the temple of God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:3 (id: 1013022003)

3David provided a lot of iron for making nails and hinges for the doors in the gates of the temple. He also provided a huge amount of bronze for making various things. There was so much bronze, no one could weigh it all.


## 1 Chronicles 22:4 (id: 1013022004)

4David also provided money for buying a lot of cedar logs for use in building the temple. Men from the cities of Tyre and Sidon brought the logs to David that he purchased. Because they brought so many logs, no one could count them.


## 1 Chronicles 22:5 (id: 1013022005)

5David provided all those things because he thought, “My son Solomon is still young and he does not yet know what he needs to know about building buildings, and the temple constructed for Yahweh must be magnificent. It must be a glorious building that will become famous, and people throughout the world must consider it beautiful. So now I will begin to prepare for its construction.” So David collected a great amount of building materials before he died.


## 1 Chronicles 22:6 (id: 1013022006)

6Then David summoned his son Solomon and told him to arrange for the construction of a temple for Yahweh, the God whom the Israelites worshipped.


## 1 Chronicles 22:7 (id: 1013022007)

7David told Solomon, “My son, I wanted to build a temple to honor Yahweh, my God.


## 1 Chronicles 22:8 (id: 1013022008)

8But Yahweh told a prophet to tell me, ‘You have killed many men in the big battles that you have fought. I have seen all the people you have killed, so you will not be the one who will arrange for the construction of a temple to honor me.


## 1 Chronicles 22:9 (id: 1013022009)

9But you will have a son who will be king of Israel after you. He will be a man without war during his reign. I will cause peace between him and his enemies who are in all the nearby lands. That is why his name will be Solomon (which sounds like the word for peace). During the time that he is king, I will provide peace and safety for the people in Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 22:10 (id: 1013022010)

10He is the one who will arrange for the construction of a temple to honor me. He will be like a son to me, and I will be like his father. I will cause his dynasty to rule over Israel forever.’


## 1 Chronicles 22:11 (id: 1013022011)

11So now, my son, I hope that Yahweh will help you and enable you to succeed in arranging for the construction of a temple for Yahweh, your God, which is what he said that you would do.


## 1 Chronicles 22:12 (id: 1013022012)

12I also hope that he will enable you to be wise and to understand what you need to know, and enable you to obey his laws while you rule over Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 22:13 (id: 1013022013)

13If you carefully obey all the laws and decrees which Yahweh told Moses to tell Israel to do, then you will do well in constructing a temple and ruling Israel. Now, demonstrate strength and courage. Do not be afraid of anything, and do not become discouraged!


## 1 Chronicles 22:14 (id: 1013022014)

14I have tried hard to provide materials for building the temple of Yahweh, including 3,300 metric tons of gold, 33,000 metric tons of silver, and a very large amount of iron and bronze (so much that no one can weigh it all). I have also gathered lumber and stone, but you will need to acquire more of those things.


## 1 Chronicles 22:15 (id: 1013022015)

15There are many men in Israel who have good ability to cut big stones and work with different types of stone, carpenters, and men who are very skilled at making various kinds of things.


## 1 Chronicles 22:16 (id: 1013022016)

16There are many men who know how to make things from gold, silver, bronze, and iron. So now I say to you, begin the work of building the temple, and I hope that Yahweh will be with you.”


## 1 Chronicles 22:17 (id: 1013022017)

17Then David commanded that all the Israelite leaders must assist his son Solomon:


## 1 Chronicles 22:18 (id: 1013022018)

18“Yahweh our God is certainly with you. He has allowed you to have peace with all the nearby nations because he has enabled my army to conquer them. Yahweh and my people control them.


## 1 Chronicles 22:19 (id: 1013022019)

19Now you must obey your God, Yahweh, with your entire lives. Help Solomon to arrange for the construction of the temple for Yahweh God, in order that you can bring the sacred chest symbolizing the agreement between Yahweh and the people of Israel and the other sacred items that belong to God into the temple that you will build to honor him.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:1 (id: 1013023001)

1David was a very old man when he appointed his son Solomon to be the next king over Israel.


## 1 Chronicles 23:2 (id: 1013023002)

2David gathered the leaders of Israel and the priests and other descendants of Levi.


## 1 Chronicles 23:3 (id: 1013023003)

3He commanded some of his officials to count the descendants of Levi who were at least 30 years old, and they found out that there were 38, 000 men.


## 1 Chronicles 23:4 (id: 1013023004)

4Then David said, “From those descendants of Levi, I want 24,000 of them to supervise the work at the temple of Yahweh, 6,000 to be officials and judges,


## 1 Chronicles 23:5 (id: 1013023005)

54,000 to be guards at the gates, and 4,000 to praise Yahweh, using the musical instruments that I have provided for them.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:6 (id: 1013023006)

6David divided the descendants of Levi into three groups; each group consisted of men who were descendants of one of the three sons of Levi—Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.


## 1 Chronicles 23:7 (id: 1013023007)

7The descendants of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.


## 1 Chronicles 23:8 (id: 1013023008)

8Ladan had three sons: the oldest Jehiel, then Zetham and Joel.


## 1 Chronicles 23:9 (id: 1013023009)

9Shimei had three sons: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. They were leaders of the clans of Ladan.


## 1 Chronicles 23:10 (id: 1013023010)

10Shimei’s sons were Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah; four in total.


## 1 Chronicles 23:11 (id: 1013023011)

11Jahath was the oldest son. Ziza was the second. Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so the officials counting the descendants of Levi counted the families of Jeush and Beriah as though they were one family.


## 1 Chronicles 23:12 (id: 1013023012)

12Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.


## 1 Chronicles 23:13 (id: 1013023013)

13Amram’s sons were Aaron and Moses. Yahweh chose Aaron, that is, Aaron and his descendants perpetually, to dedicate to Yahweh the very holy things, to offer sacrifices to Yahweh, to serve in his presence, and to declare to the people what Yahweh would do to bless them. They were to do those things forever.


## 1 Chronicles 23:14 (id: 1013023014)

14The officials counting the descendants of Levi counted the descendants of Moses, the man who served God well, as part of the tribe of Levi.


## 1 Chronicles 23:15 (id: 1013023015)

15Moses’ sons were Gershom and Eliezer.


## 1 Chronicles 23:16 (id: 1013023016)

16The oldest son of Gershom was Shubael.


## 1 Chronicles 23:17 (id: 1013023017)

17Eliezer’s oldest child was Rehabiah. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many sons.


## 1 Chronicles 23:18 (id: 1013023018)

18Izhar’s oldest son was Shelomith.


## 1 Chronicles 23:19 (id: 1013023019)

19Hebron had four sons. Jeriah was his oldest son; Amariah was the second; Jahaziel was the third; and Jekameam was the fourth.


## 1 Chronicles 23:20 (id: 1013023020)

20Uzziel had two sons. Micah was the older son, and Isshiah was the younger.


## 1 Chronicles 23:21 (id: 1013023021)

21Merari had two sons: Mahli and Mushi. Mahli’s sons were Eleazar and Kish.


## 1 Chronicles 23:22 (id: 1013023022)

22Eleazar died without having sons; he only had daughters. Their cousins, Kish’s sons, married them.


## 1 Chronicles 23:23 (id: 1013023023)

23Mushi had three sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.


## 1 Chronicles 23:24 (id: 1013023024)

24Those were the descendants of Levi that the officials counted according to the descendants’ families and the leaders of those families, as well as according to the descendants’ special jobs and the leaders of those jobs. They all worked in the temple of Yahweh. The officials counted each person who was at least 20 years old.


## 1 Chronicles 23:25 (id: 1013023025)

25David had said previously, “Yahweh, the God to whom we Israelite people belong, has enabled us to have peace, and he has come to live in Jerusalem forever.


## 1 Chronicles 23:26 (id: 1013023026)

26Therefore, the descendants of Levi no longer need to carry the sacred tent and all the items used in the work there.”


## 1 Chronicles 23:27 (id: 1013023027)

27Obeying David’s final instructions before he died, instructions for doing the work at the temple, the officials counted the descendants of Levi who were at least twenty years old.


## 1 Chronicles 23:28 (id: 1013023028)

28The work of those descendants of Levi was to assist the descendants of Aaron in their work in Yahweh’s temple. They were in charge of the temple courtyards and the side rooms, the ceremonies for purifying all the sacred things, and to do other work at the temple.

## 1 Chronicles 29:14 (id: 1013029014)

14But I and my people are not really able to give anything to you, because everything that we have comes from you; the things that we have given to you are only the things that we have received from you.


## 1 Chronicles 29:15 (id: 1013029015)

15You know that we are like foreigners and strangers to you, as our ancestors were. Our years here on earth are like a shadow that disappears quickly; we know that there is nothing that can enable us to escape dying.


## 1 Chronicles 29:16 (id: 1013029016)

## 1 Chronicles 29:17 (id: 1013029017)

## 1 Chronicles 29:21 (id: 1013029021)
